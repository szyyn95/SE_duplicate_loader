# Experiment Overlook

1. Does the type of intermediate task matter? (EXP Code: TYPE<XX>)


2. Does the ratio of target task in the intermediate task matter? (EXP Code: RAT<XX>)

3. Semantic similarity analysis of false negatives / false positives.
**Analysis done from results obtained in TYPE and RAT experiments above.
