I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&quot;&gt;my previous question here on Meta&lt;/a&gt;, you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&quot;&gt;relevant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, a technical consideration: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point that I've read in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&quot;&gt;some postings and comments here&lt;/a&gt; is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&quot;&gt;first mentioned in a comment here&lt;/a&gt;, some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions.

It involves requiring certain tags on the main site (similar to how tags such as &quot;discussion&quot; are required on Meta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The categories that compose Computer Science on ArXiv that appear to be within scope of TCS are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;artificial-intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;complexity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;computational-geometry&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;game-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vision&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;security (instead of just cryptography, to include stenography without a long tag - and I would love to see some stego questions here.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;data-structures&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;databases&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;discrete mathematics (this is probably off-topic and should be on Mathematics?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;distributed-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;parallel-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cluster-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;formal-languages / automata-theory (need to clean this up somehow, perhaps even splitting them into two tags, such as how I split data-structures and algorithms into two tags, even though they are a single ArXiv topic area)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;graphics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-retrieval&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;multiagent-systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;performance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;programming-languages&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;evolutionary-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that a few off-topic ones probably slipped through. But the point is, these are the topic areas within ArXiv that are relevant to this site. Simply make it so that one or more of these tags is required. Drop the entire beginning portion and only go with the plain-English name. On the tag wiki for each one, provide the full ArXiv name (cs.XX.whatever) and link to the page for each one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that some have been broken up. &quot;data-structures&quot; and &quot;algorithms&quot; are separate tags, even though there is one arXiv section for both. I think they are separate enough to warrant being broken up here, but the tag wiki page for each would link to the same section or the ArXiv site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this actually makes everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) We are using standardized names presented in ArXiv that have well-defined meanings. This is good for categorizing content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) The tags are in plain English, which will mean that people searching using the built-in search as well as coming from Google will see only the portion of the tag that is relevant to their query.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) The tags are short, simple, and beginner-friendly. I'm not an expert on any of these topics, but I can clearly define what most, if not all, of these areas encompass. I look at &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot; and know what &quot;complexity-theory&quot; means, but I have no clue of the significance of &quot;cc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) We can be better assured that every question posted to TCS is actually on-topic. If it doesn't fall into one of the knowledge areas that is required, then the question is off-topic and belongs somewhere else. For example, if we didn't put discrete-mathematics on the required list, someone would have to take a look and try to attach another tag to it. Either they would succeed and it would be good or they wouldn't and then wouldn't be able to post it here without making up a tag. Even so, however, there might be subtopics within each of these areas that is off-topic, so that would need to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address some of the comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For filtering purposes. If you just take the top-level tags and mark some of them as &quot;interesting&quot; and some &quot;ignored&quot;, you'll immediately have a very effective filter. If we have the policy that each question is tagged with at least one &quot;top level tag&quot;, your filter should work pretty well. On the other hand, if we just have a large collection of tags that people can use and create however they want, maintaining your filter and keeping it effective (and spotting false positives/negatives) becomes a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it matters if you have top-level tags for filtering. It's good to have very specific, well-defined tags that mean something specific and where many people know their meaning. Having ambiguous words/phrases/keywords as tags would be a problem, but it doesn't matter what the tag is as long as anyone can look at it and tell what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the use of any tags - I would like to first point out Stack Overflow, Super User, and Server Fault. They allow for random tags, yet the users are able to find and filter based on their preferences. It all boils down to the fact that in a folksonomy, the tags and their meanings will eventually converge. You might be interested in reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/guy/01guy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Folksonomies: Tidying Up Tags?&lt;/a&gt;, and Clay Shirky's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ontology is Overrated&lt;/a&gt;. I can recommend a number of other papers on folksonomies and ontologies if you are interested, but the short story is that tagging needs to be more organic and less structured for it to develop meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And regarding filters: this site only works if people can use it to get good answers from the experts. We should make the life of those who are looking for relevant questions that they could answer as easy as possible. With &quot;top level tags&quot;, you can just mark your own field of expertise as &quot;interesting&quot; and then check cstheory.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=mytags whenever you have time. Or subscribe to the relevant RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using plain English terms from a source would accomplish this as well. It doesn't matter if you use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IEEE Computer Science Keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/acm_categories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ACM Categories&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Computing Research Repository subject areas&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you have a community practice (either community enforced or by requiring at least one tag from a group of tags), people will be able to find things. It doesn't matter what that tag is. However, I personally feel that &quot;complexity-theory&quot; is much easier to manage than &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot;. It's more familiar to people who don't use/know ArXiv, but it uses the exact same subject name, allowing people who are interested in the ArXiv knowledge area of complexity theory to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have a long list of 'uninteresting' tags so as to get rid of topics I don't care about. top level tagging helps me focus positively on stuff I do care about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is accomplished with any tagging system, given enough time (see the papers and articles I linked to in response to the first comment). It does help to have tags from Day 1 that are meaningful, see my response to the second comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There's a risk that required tags will be confusing for new users. I'm inclined to 'educate' new users, by retagging their questions, but this wouldn't work well if (i) users would be put off by having tags added, or (ii) the retagging would tend not to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is also a good idea, as long as the full ArXiv tags are not used. Like I've said many times, ArXiv tags are too unwieldy. The simplest, and best community-oriented approach (see any number of research reports on developing folksonomies) would be free tagging. However, that doesn't seem to be of interest to the community here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as retagging goes, if the community doesn't edit posts and tags, then the community is failing and this Stack Exchange probably won't survive.

I don't think we are yet on course to be a successful Q&amp;amp;A site for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no users who I would call names to conjure with.  This matters for any site: e.g., SO has many active users who are highly recognised experts for a large number of topics, and the SX folk think that this is essential to SOs success and will be essential to the sites coming through the SX beta phase. For academic Q&amp;amp;A sites, as opposed to problem-solving sites I think this is even more important.  How important has Terence Tao's endorsement of MO been to that site's success?  The other two beta sites I've participated in, math.SX and tex.SX, had done far better by their 10th day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a lack of high reputation users.  We don't have any 1k+ reputation users at all, so apart from the SX moderators, we have no-one who can edit weak questions, let alone access the moderation tools. It takes five 500+ users to close a question without moderator actions; we have 8.  We have only 23x 250+ users who can retag.  To some extent, this is a fact of life about the early public beta stage, but other sites have done better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little interest has been shown, or effort put into in the things that need to be done on meta to make the site a success.  Shane is our distinguished exception, Suresh has put in some effort, as well.

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&quot;&gt;meta profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&quot;&gt;site profile&lt;/a&gt;). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack&quot;&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer.

The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T10:19:34.057" CommentCount="4" />

I'm an undergraduate enrolled in a Computer Science program. I have plans to triple major with Mathematics and I'm looking at enrolling in a graduate school. I have found my undergraduate degree underwhelming - the program at my school focuses very strongly on the engineering aspects of Computer Science I'd learned myself during K-12. I supplement my education at this university with extracurricular learning (personal projects as often as reading papers or introductory material on mathematical topics). CSTheory/TheoryOverflow has been one of my bids to do this outside learning. Namely, I've been trying to answer questions well when I have relevant knowledge (or know where to find the answer) and I read questions that I are beyond my current state of knowledge, adding referenced materials and authors to my queue. I plan on using the site to ask questions about papers as I read them and also to request references for 'cursory' introductions or high level explanations of complicated topics in the field so that I can get intuition regarding concepts undergraduate learning hasn't prepared me for (things like 'sparsity as related to compressive sensing' or 'why Mulmuley GCT appears to be a strong approach').&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you have general thoughts about the future of the site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a few occassions now I have had serious doubts about this stackexchange. Usually these are brought on by specific experiences on the site, be they encounters with a less agreeable person or a severely bad question/answer. To echo what some others have said, I have found the number of CW/big-list questions asked here to be undesirable. Specifically, I think the distribution of questions asked on the stack exchange to be bimodal - many clustered at the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; end where lots of users can submit answers (sometimes even very subjective or discussion-like answers) with exceptions being those questions that are targeted toward very specific subdomain expertise (and often I have noticed a large number of questions involve asking already widely studied open questions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would personally prefer a site with a normal distribution - less low hanging fruit and less very, very niche questions (but some of both). The majority of the questions, I think, should be medium-to-hard level research questions that &lt;em&gt;aren't previously asked open questions&lt;/em&gt; and which include a strong statement motivating why the question is interesting and whose resolution or reduction to other well-known questions can serve as expository examples for clever techniques, facts and lemmas in the field. (Of course a good variety of questions are welcome - I myself would plan to ask specific questions about steps in proofs.) To put it more succinctly, I haven't really noticed any original &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; being written here - this is diametrically opposed to MathOverflow. Of course, I think this might be unfair to ask for in the first 10 days of the site. But this is what I imagine the site's goal being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do hope that this site (or a site like it) succeeds. I found the number of users involved in the site surprisingly large and active (although I have very little experience with stackexchange websites or community forums to compare against). I have found some of the questions and answers on the site interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the count of high-reputations users is low, I have noticed issues being resolved in what I believe to be a reasonable turn-around time. There have been two distinct occasions (that I can remember) where I have visited some hours after I first notice an issue, only to see it resolved.

As someone who hasn't done graduate coursework in TCS, I find the CW/big-list questions very helpful.

I know that you don't want the mix of questions to become too elementary and put off the serious researchers.  It would be nice to be able to segregate the more basic questions from the advanced, but given that the theory community is small, there probably aren't enough people to support two separate StackExchange sites.  And hopefully some of the people asking basic questions will eventually be asking (and answering) more advanced stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's one little idea that might be workable: ask that anyone posting a question that could be considered undergrad-level material to tag it with something like &quot;intro&quot;.  Then anyone who doesn't want that stuff cluttering up their view could add the intro tag to their ignore filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think over time the mix of questions is going to include more like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/34/how-hard-is-unshuffling-a-string&quot;&gt;Jeff Erickson's&lt;/a&gt;, and this will become a less sensitive issue.

When in doubt, do not mark a question CW – this can always be changed later.  A crucial technical point: any answers made to a CW question will themselves be CW.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often, a question that seems like it should be CW can be modified to be more direct and focused, thus avoiding the need for the tag.

If you do not want to think about the question by yourself, ask yourself whether you really care about the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that you must not ask a question unless you have proved that you cannot answer it by yourself (which is obviously impossible).  However, make some reasonable effort to try to answer your own question before posting it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even if you care about the question, the reader may not know it.  Therefore, it is a good idea to include some evidences that you care about it in the question.  Doing so also helps the reader to understand the question better and hopefully results in better answers.

At this stage of the site it seems unnecessary to have such long tag wikis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is my suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A tag wiki should explain what the tag is for (when the tag name doesn't explain it well enough) and perhaps contain a reference (to a website or book) to explain what the concept is. Usually Wikipedia links should suffice for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions? Comments?

The SCTT is a statement about the physical world we live in, so a zealous poster might downvote and vote to close based on it being a physical proposition. I don't agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another example, consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/602382.602411&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this paper by Andrew Yao&lt;/a&gt; which appeared in the Journal of the ACM.

In fact, Lance's question starts with &quot;From a physics perspective...&quot;.

For example, it would be better if the question identified some problem with using bits of precision as a basis of information in a physical system, and asked how this might be resolved.

In one respect, things are going fairly well. Our traffic is steadily increasing: from an early number of around 2500 visits/day, we are now at 3200 visits/day. We also have nearly 1500 registered users (part of this is no doubt some reddit love we got for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki&quot;&gt;a post on functional data structures&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, I think our numbers overestimate the true penetration of the site within the theoryCS community at large. Here's an experiment I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Estimate the fraction of users with a&#xA;  reputation in the range $(1, 101) \cup&#xA;&amp;gt; [102, \infty)$, and compare this to the fraction of MO users in the range $(1, \infty)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this is that merely signing up gets you a reputation score of 1, or 101 if you come in via the SE system. So that score doesn't reflect any actual involvement. MO on the other hand is an SE 1.0 site, and so they don't have the 101 bonus. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While in one respect this is an unfair comparison, because MO has been around a lot longer, it's not entirely unfair because we're only comparing ratios here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TCS: roughly 20%&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  MO: roughly 40%  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(I did a crude approximation by looking&#xA;  at number of &lt;em&gt;pages&lt;/em&gt; of users, because&#xA;  I have a life :))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this might suggest that our relatively large user numbers (relative to this stage in the beta) is an illusion, and so we need to work more at getting people in the community to participate. I know for a fact that many of my colleagues even in the narrow realm of computational geometry aren't here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have too many concrete ideas apart from some of the suggestions from the last post. But maybe it's a matter of doing more in-community - mentioning the site in talks, citing the site generously when appropriate, and encouraging co-workers and students to post questions (note that I'm not mentioning things like twitter which only touch a small fraction of the &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; community)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-09-29T15:00:44.850" Title="Site Promotion: the next phase" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;7-essential&gt;&lt;site-promotion&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" />

I do not have an answer, but here is what I thought about this specific question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I agree with you that the asker was just asking for a broad literature search to get accustomed to a field, and the asker has not shown the evidence that he/she has tried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I see some inconsistency when I compare this question to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/710/quantum-computing-project-ideas&quot;&gt;the question asking for ideas of graduation projects about quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;, which has been perceived positively.  One is about the literature search and the other is about project proposals, but this difference does not seem important (if anything, asking for the literature is &lt;em&gt;more specific&lt;/em&gt;).  Note that the question about quantum computing projects does not show any evidence of prior efforts, either.  Moreover, I feel that the topic “applications of the fuzzy logic to pattern recognition” is more specific than “quantum computing” (I may be biased here; quantum computing is my field of research, and I am not familiar with either the fuzzy logic or pattern recognition).  I have a difficulty justifying the difference of people’s responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;:  Just to make sure, the question on quantum computing projects I am talking about is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1715/long-term-project-on-quantum-computing&quot;&gt;more recent question about how to write a research proposal on applications of evolutionary algorithms to quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;.

To my knowledge there is no such place. The problem is that as a student you do often not have the resources (time, journal access, starting points) to do an extensive literature search while CS lectures are oftentimes very vague on the theoretical details. For example, I remember attending a lecture on pattern recognition that had many holes regarding stochastics. If you were really interested, you would have loads of questions outside of this lecture's scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think it would be great to have a website where people could just ask their questions and get them answered. Yes, there will be the same questions over and over again. But think of the advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People get help for TCS which reduces potential of intimidation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who can provide better help?

There's an ubuntu SE site that was created around the same time as this one. It's already been promoted to a full site, because Canonical (the folks that make ubuntu) took it over and are using it as a replacement of sorts for their forums. I contacted the SE admins about this, and they are more than willing to do the same thing (go into partnership with another organization) for us, if we can work out the logistics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was going to either email Lance (SIGACT chair) or see if he'd be at FOCS and bring up the idea. The logistics of doing this is not entirely clear, but it sounds like the main added value is branding, and that SE would still maintain the software base etc. I have a contact at SE to liaise with on this front if we wanted to go forward with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I don't think SIGACT will miraculously make things better in terms of participation, and I think we should continue doing what Kaveh and Ian are proposing (although I'm not so sure about Reddit/Slashdot), I think that getting the imprimatur of an organization means that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;we could pick our own domain name (under sigact) maybe&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;we wouldn't need to constantly worry whether SE would pull the plug (I think)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We get the kind of centralized &quot;conference room&quot; that Lance has also been talking about&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I'll be honest. I have enough work with my regular job that I can't focus a lot of time on all these things. But there are enough people here on meta that I think together we can achieve a fair amount of this, especially the tasks that Kaveh suggests. I can volunteer to talk with SIGACT about the first few points above, with the idea of eventually broaching the third. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p.s as an aside, I believe that in the early days of MO, the participants &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; do a lot of explicit solicitations to get people involved in the site. I think if each of us could get 3-4 new people to start contributing, we'd do well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update from FOCS&lt;/strong&gt;: I have informal blessing to do all three of the things I mentioned above, btw.

I find it relatively easy to generate a question, but require nontrivial effort to turn this into a good question, including filtering out the questions of lesser quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, the questions that I believe are likely to further research (as opposed to being interesting but less productive) tend to be quite specific.  Such questions receive little attention overall, and even less when someone posts a precise answer that is then quickly accepted.  The number of questions per user is definitely quite low, and I detect a tendency toward shorter questions that are less likely to be research-level (this is just a perception and may be incorrect).  The site metrics essentially encourage such questions, which has implications for the long term character of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't strongly care about my personal site reputation, but &quot;reputation points&quot; form the main mechanism used by the site to direct activity in certain ways.

Let me start with a few that I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Spam&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think spam is easy to recognize when you see it. Spam posts are usually meaningless (&quot;ljhasdfsd 765hg as 5ghfdh654fg 9sa78d&quot;), advertisements for a product (&quot;This software is the best, click here to try it&quot;) or advertisements in general (&quot;Click here to win a free iPod&quot;). There are probably more examples of spam that I haven't listed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Offensive&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also quite clear. Examples include name calling, abusive words, defamation (or more technically libel), etc. Most often these are off-topic, and sometimes about sensitive issues, like religion, 9/11, beliefs, racism, etc. These should be deleted for the double reason of being off-topic AND offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Off topic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If something is clearly off topic, it should be deleted. For example a meaningful question which should be deleted is &quot;Where can I buy a good quality, second hand Eric Clapton Stratocaster® by Fender in Canada?&quot; I'm sure this question has a good answer, but this is just the wrong forum for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Illegal&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also quite clear. When someone posts a link to an illegal website, book, etc. In the context of TCS, &quot;illegal&quot; will usually mean copyrighted stuff being made available in an unauthorized manner for free. However, there are other illegal things that should also be deleted on sight, but these would mostly also be off topic, so there's more than one good reason to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;OP wants it deleted&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should probably be discussed in a separate question.

Are we going to punish the users for undeleting it? Are we going to delete it again?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don't see any reason legally or ethically for not copying an answer. What is the ethical principle that is being violated? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO, copying answers is completely compatible with the philosophy of the site. Let me quote a part of FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Other people can edit my stuff?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like Wikipedia, this site is collaboratively edited, and all edits are tracked. &lt;strong&gt;If you are not comfortable with the idea of your questions and answers being edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is clear about the philosophy of SE. If you are not happy about copying answers, I respect your view. But if you are saying that it is inappropriate or unethical and/or if you are trying to draw lines too strictly about how other users or moderators should act, and about what is appropriate and what is not, sorry, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit 10/26/2010&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Tsuyoshi that there is not a need to agree on everything, i.e. I agree with Tsuyoshi to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My main point here is on how conservative we should be on what trusted users/moderators can do.&lt;/strong&gt; My view, as I wrote above, is that we should trust decisions made by others and be very liberal, we don't need to discuss every decision made by others, unless there is a conflict/disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me also make it clear that there is a difference between being nice to others and what is ethical. An action can be considered &quot;not being nice to others&quot;, but still don't violate any ethical principles. Being nice is boarder than being ethical (in this context).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let me return to the particular case of this question.&#xA;My sentence about the ethical principle being violated is in the context of our discussion, i.e. the appropriate use of &lt;em&gt;this site&lt;/em&gt;. The argument, if I understood it correctly, is that we should respect the decision made by OP about deleting their post, and I guess this is based on the view that &lt;em&gt;OP own what they have posted&lt;/em&gt;. I am not sure I agree with this. Again if I understood the philosophy of the site correctly, it is very similar to Wikipedia, and it is a collaborative effort. If you have posted something, others can modify, edit, or even copy-and-post it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some discussion on why it is not clear to me if a post is owned by OP, specially a CW post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. When someone posts an answer/questions, it means that other users are probably going to avoid posting similar content,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. People vote for the answer,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;III. Other answers may refer to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Removing a post can also be considered as not respecting the questioner, other user answering the question, and the votes given to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if it is CW, i.e. &lt;em&gt;community wiki&lt;/em&gt;, it is more involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IV. CW answers are owned by community, they are edited by other users, and removing a post can cause even more problems in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assume that we have a CW question about what is the most famous problem in TCS, and someone posts &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot;, and of course receive lots of votes, after a few months the OP goes back and removes the answer. Assume that no one notices this. Think how it would look like if someone from outside or a new user reads the question and does not see an &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot; answer?!

Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;cs.theory.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362&quot;&gt;new research collaborations among computer scientists&lt;/a&gt; who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453&quot;&gt;an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo&lt;/a&gt;; Scott Aaronson summarized the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2045/are-there-canonical-non-relativizing-techniques/2048#2048&quot;&gt;state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques&lt;/a&gt;; Jeff Erickson explained why &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2119/the-reasons-for-bss-real-ram-model-being-prefered-in-computational-geometry/2124#2124&quot;&gt;the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry&lt;/a&gt;; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239&quot;&gt;an answer from Noam Nisan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/max-cut-with-negative-weight-edges/2318#2318&quot;&gt;reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights&lt;/a&gt;; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2505/is-the-dominating-set-problem-restricted-to-planar-bipartite-graphs-of-maximum-de/2508#2508&quot;&gt;DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3&lt;/a&gt;; Sariel Har-Peled showed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1651/hamiltonicity-of-k-regular-graphs/1656#1656&quot;&gt;Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k&lt;/a&gt;; and Per Vognsen outlined a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1772/alternative-proofs-of-schwartzzippel-lemma/1883#1883&quot;&gt;proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1893/how-do-i-referee-a-paper&quot;&gt;how to referee papers&lt;/a&gt;, possible &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic&quot;&gt;Master's thesis topics in automata theory&lt;/a&gt;, pointers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki&quot;&gt;recent purely functional data structures&lt;/a&gt;, suggestions for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2386/inspirational-talk-for-final-year-high-school-pupils/2411#2411&quot;&gt;inspirational talk about theoretical computer science&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job&quot;&gt;how to find a job&lt;/a&gt;.  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.  The overall scope of the site is &lt;strong&gt;research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Note that homework questions are not allowed on the site&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account.  We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Site Origin and Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the founding members of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;cstheory.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Meta&quot; area&lt;/a&gt;, for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Who runs the site?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

Perhaps you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/problems-that-can-be-used-to-show-polynomial-time-hardness-results/&quot;&gt;a list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results, to strengthen your toolkit of reductions&lt;/a&gt;.  Or perhaps you think a problem might be open -- but might just as easily be solved -- so &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2379/refereed-games-with-uncorrelated-semi-private-coins&quot;&gt;you'd like to ask a group of professionals what they think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have comments on each of the four examples in this opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) I'd guess that most computer scientists have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wondered how the Axiom of Choice matters to CS; most probably just think that it doesn't. The fact that we got a really interesting answer to the contrary is a success story for the site.  One of the things I enjoy most about the site is that I have learned interesting answers to questions I never would have thought to ask, not because they are not in my area, but because I always assumed the answer was trivial or never had occasion to think about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Are there any non-CS-mathematicians who read SIGACT News?  (Indeed, even the OP for that question is chair of his CS department, in addition to a joint appointment in the Math Dept.) Laurent Beinvenu's answer to that question was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, but I think we need to rephrase how we're selling it in this opening paragraph. I'm not sure the following is a good way, but I'll just note that his answer is like a short tutorial/primer on ML-randomness (basically all it lacks is the most recent results), something which might appear in a publication like SIGACT News. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the amount of effort to write such a thing for such a publication is much greater than on this site, and would take several months to go through the publication pipeline, if it happened at all.  Here we got a direct line to the source, and we got just the part of the tutorial we wanted, right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) A list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results seems like a great resource for graduate students and people entering that area of research fresh, but I imagine experts in that area are familiar enough with the literature to have produced much of the entire list on their own. I think it's important that the paragraph clearly recognizes the correct audience for such a question, as is already done in the first two examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, maybe (but I'm not sure) a good way to think about it is that such a list is like part of a short tutorial that might appear in a publication like SIGACT News, but with a much lower barrier to creation (but still high quality).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) The last example is great.  It's universal: it applies to graduate students &lt;em&gt;and experts&lt;/em&gt;, everyone has had an experience where they wished they could do exactly this.  And on this site, you can. It's a great pre-punch-line for this paragraph (the punchline, of course, being &quot;Visit tcs.se&quot; on the next line).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2010-10-31T16:24:53.833" CommentCount="2" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-10-31T16:24:53.833" />

All it takes is one &quot;defector.&quot;  This is complicated by the fact that there can be a difference of opinion as to whether something is homework, and again, once one person decides a question is not homework and answers it, the restraint among the remaining members is for naught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have a couple options, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could not to worry about helping with homework, as the ethical violation is mostly on the person asking the question, not the person answering.

The OP specifically indicated that they were blocked on an NP-hardness question related to their actual work, and Tsuyoshi's comment was all they needed.

Another example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/csp&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;csp&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;csp&lt;/a&gt;; renaming it to “constraint-satisfaction-problem” might have been better, but the system does not support this long tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some tags have closely related tags which may be more appropriate for particular questions (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/approximation-algorithms&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;approximation-algorithms&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;approximation-algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, to which &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/approximation-hardness&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;approximation-hardness&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;approximation-hardness&lt;/a&gt; is a possible alternative).  Other tags deserve some explanation of usage (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/big-list&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;big-list&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;big-list&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/open-problem&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;open-problem&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;open-problem&lt;/a&gt;).  I do not think that tag wiki is a very effective place to write this kind of explanation, but we do not have many choices anyway, so I think that writing tag wiki is one of the best options available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than these cases, it seems to me that tag wiki is completely optional.

The rough maxim here was: &quot;a site for experts will draw non-experts, but not the converse&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question is really two parts: why are we closing questions quickly, and why are we being unpleasant in doing so ? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first part, I think there was a natural desire to &quot;clean the front page&quot; in the beginning so as to set the tone for what questions are considered desirable. while I don't think we're sufficiently mature that we can let go of this responsibility, I think it's ok to spend more time working with the OP to fix a question, and maybe we can be more constructive in our suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the second part, I think that occasionally some folks do get a little stroppy, and this is uncalled for. We should all remember that things written in comments can be misconstrued easily, and so we have to bend over backwards to be constructive and civil in our responses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said all of this, I will admit to frustration when a number of iterations through the comments fails to improve the question, because the OP, rather than fixing the question, merely answers the comments with more comments.

However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my research on the design, I've been going through the type of questions asked on the site and your design ideas in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; post.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GSYbD.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the Turing Machine and DFA suggestions.

I wanted to make one aesthetic suggestion, though: I think the title &quot;THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE&quot; can be made more appealing by using the Title-Case instead of UPPER-CASE: &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot;. A Turing tape does not necessarily hold upper-case symbols, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more suggestion: In computer science, there's a notion of &lt;strong&gt;oracles&lt;/strong&gt;. Informally, they are functions that &quot;know&quot; the answer to some specified question, and can compute and return it in &lt;strong&gt;one step&lt;/strong&gt;. I think this concept can be used in the design; specifically when an expert (the oracle) answers a question. Specifically, I like the idea with up-voting/down-voting a question/answer. One can imagine the oracle concept replacing the &quot;pen tips&quot; in the TeX design:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcBty.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="873" LastActivityDate="2010-11-29T10:05:58.600" CommentCount="9" />

The uppercase sigma is strongly related to discrete mathematics (because the symbol is used for summation), and it is true that theoretical computer science uses discrete mathematics a lot, but theoretical computer science is not the same as discrete mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, without a better alternative, the uppercase sigma is an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be/314#314&quot;&gt;DFA idea&lt;/a&gt; as is used in Suresh’s publicity materials, but it will not be recognizable in a 16×16-pixel favicon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Typewriter font&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the use of typewriter font in the website title written on a tape of a Turing machine.  On the other hand, as Suresh said, I am worried about the use of typewriter font in question titles, too, but for a different reason.  Some of the question titles are long, and typewriter font takes too much width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not think that a mix of two fonts is bad by itself.  I am not sure if we want to use the same roman font in both question titles and question bodies just because they can contain MathJax math.  &lt;del&gt;In my (uneducated) opinion, question bodies are probably better in a roman font but question titles can be sans-serif.&lt;/del&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Edit: I removed the last sentence; see my reply to Jin in a comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2010-11-30T11:49:50.503" CommentCount="4" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and a side effect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP wants to allow others to edit,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question is a ranking list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example I think a question like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/45/what-are-good-references-to-understanding-the-proof-of-the-pcp-theorem&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2953/advice-on-good-research-practices&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ps:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218&quot;&gt;these answers&lt;/a&gt;.

However, if the edit is within five minutes from the original post or the last edit, it does not become a new revision but simply overwrites the last revision.  Usually we do not have to be aware of this, but it becomes relevant if we try to write a sensible edit summary (in the “Edit Summary” textbox on the edit page) because overwriting the revision also overwrites the edit summary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose that you posted an answer, and made a heavy edit one week later.  You wrote the summary “improved the analysis significantly.”  Just after you hit the “Save Edits” button, you realized several typos in your answer and fixed it with the summary “fixed typos.”  Now the revision history shows an interesting thing: it shows only two revisions, and the newer revision making the significant improvement is shown with the summary “fixed typos.”  :(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This happened to me on MathOverflow.

I am not a lawyer and what I am not sure if what I write below is correct (it would be nice if people from SE ask their lawyers to verify/clarify them for us). Also it would be nice to know the policy on similar sites like Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I think we should separate the issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing is which law? I think the answer is the law of the state/country that the servers for SE are placed. That is the law that applies to the site and having an international community does not change it. The site is responsible under that law, not say Russian law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second issue is who is responsible against law if something bad happens. I think the person who has committed the illegal activity is responsible, I don't think the community or the moderators are responsible, and if something goes wrong that is the problem of people in SE (the community and the moderators are helping the SE people, but obviously the owner of the site is SE and we are not responsible if someone else does something wrong). (I am not sure what will happen when ACM becomes involved, but my guess is that they would not like to have any kind of legal responsibility about such matters.) So &lt;em&gt;I don't think we (community/moderators) have a duty to remove illegal stuff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third issue is do the responsible people for the site have a duty and legal obligation to remove the illegal stuff in general? Again, I don't think so. We and they are not lawyers and cannot make the decisions about what is legal and what is illegal. I am guessing this based on the discussion on MO. The situation is obviously different if there is a court order and/or they are obliged to remove some stuff under some law (say DCMA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forth issue which was &lt;em&gt;my intention&lt;/em&gt; when I asked this question is about our own policy, not about legal obligations/duties. Should we allow things like links to copyrighted books where it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; that they are not legal? This is not about law, this is about what we think and what policy should we have, and the decisions are of course will be somewhat subjective as other decisions we make about closing or deleting posts. So the main question is &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Do we (i.e. the cstheory community) think it is OK and suitable to have such links on a professional site?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; I don't know. I personally don't like the current copyright laws, but is it OK in our opinion to allow links to unauthorized online copies of books written by our colleagues? The people on MO seem to be OK with this unless there is a complaint (say from the author). The people on SO seem to have a different opinion. The other issue is the consequences of a decision. What will be the effect of allowing them on questions/answers/community? What will be the effect of discouraging them? What will be the effect of disallowing them? Should a question asking for an illegal online copy of a copyrighted book permitted? Or such links in answers to a CW question about online books? ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2011-01-16T11:05:02.857" CommentCount="11" />

But if (for example) someday someone starts &quot;music.stackexchange.com&quot;, and it becomes a safe haven for copyright infringement that hurts the bottom line of someone who cares, I would bet real and significant amounts of money that lawyers for some company somewhere will come after you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the short version of what I'm saying is:  Don't ban illegal activity at your own risk.  And by &quot;your own&quot; I mean &quot;StackOverflow's.&quot;  Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1338" LastActivityDate="2011-01-19T01:00:35.567" CommentCount="2" />

Stack Exchange (SE) uses a method of election called Single Transferable Votes (STV). AFAIK, this mechanism is recently incorporated into SE, and therefore it might be alien to some users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a very simple description of the method, taken from Wikipedia. It is rather short, and I encourage everyone (who is not familiar with STV) to take a look at it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Suppose a food election is conducted to determine what to serve at a party. There are 5 candidates, 3 of which will be chosen. The candidates are: &lt;em&gt;Oranges, Pears, Chocolate, Strawberries, and Sweets&lt;/em&gt;. The 20 guests at the party have their ballots marked according to the table below. In this example, a second choice is needed by only some of the voters, however with a different vote distribution additional preferences may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://s1.bild.me/bilder/311010/4539751vote1.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;First, the quota is calculated. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Droop quota&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 voters and 3 winners to be found, the number of votes required to be elected is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;$\left({\mbox{20 votes cast} \over {\mbox{3 seats to fill}+1}}\right) +1 = \mbox{6 votes required}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When ballots are counted the election proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://s1.bild.me/bilder/311010/2883562vote2.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; The winners are &lt;strong&gt;Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Oranges&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Strawberries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last note: The counting method for SE elections is a bit different, in that it changes the quota continuously at each round.

The official explanation for this restriction, which I cannot find where I saw for now, is “Allowing unlimited undoing would open up the possibility of gaming the system.”  Namely, if you want your answer to be voted up, you could vote down the other answers so that your answer will be shown on the top of the page (because the other answers have now negative score) and lazy users will read only your answer and upvote it.  The downside of this strategy is that you lose 1 rep point every time you cast a downvote, but if you can undo the votes, you can cancel your downvotes after a week or so when no one cares what happens in a question which does not appear on the top page.  Moreover, canceling the downvotes hides the evidence that you have cast many downvotes (the number of upvotes and downvotes you have cast is available on your profile page).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many (seemingly silly) restrictions on Stack Exchange websites like this originate from the same logic of preventing gaming the system.  I guess that these restrictions came from the real experience by the admins at Stack Overflow Internet Services, Inc., on Stack Overflow and other sites which have longer history than ours.  I appreciate the fact that the admins put their experiences to form the whole Stack Exchange network.  However, I am worried by their general tendency of overreacting to the fear that someone may game the system.  I believe that different communities have different priorities and that earning the rep points is not considered to be as important in cstheory.stackexchange.com as in more popular sites such as Stack Overflow.

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science&quot;&gt;Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&quot;&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&lt;/a&gt; is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange&lt;/strong&gt; is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; questions in &lt;em&gt;theoretical computer science&lt;/em&gt; (TCS).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Research-level mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/&quot;&gt;Math Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Programming — &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;General mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics - Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;; they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.

It's a terrific, robust, and growing community that is clearly making an increasing contribution to the state of CS Theory research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something we keep thinking about, though, in the context of the entire Stack Exchange network, is how broad a Stack Exchange site should be. I blogged about this a little bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So: the right size might be somewhere around the size of a university department. Somehow, the cultural anthropologists don’t mind sharing a building with the physical anthropologists, and when they both find themselves at the Yale-Harvard football game, you can bet that they’ll sit together and find something anthropological to talk about. Similarly, at Stack Overflow, the Java Entity Bean programmers at insurance companies don’t mind all the iPhone developers asking Objective C questions about the horrible, horrible game they’re working on. Heck, they might become iPhone developers one day. And they both share the humiliation of not being able to fix their uncle’s virus-infested Windows XP machine when they’re home for Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that leads to the obvious question... is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; site too narrow? I don't know of many universities that have a Theoretical Computer Science department; they all have Computer Science departments and the algorithms purists don't seem to mind having Friday tea with the computer vision geeks. And the idea of meeting somebody who is working on AI is, it turns out, not &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; too horrible to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm concerned that there are non-theoretical aspects of Computer Science research that don't have a home right now. If you look around Area51 you'll see proposals for crpytography, operating systems, compilers, cognitive science, numerical modeling, computer vision, bioinformatics, history of computers, and a lot of other fields that aren't quite reaching critical mass. We had an AI site that failed to ignite due to a lack of actual AI researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying all of those are on topic, but if a university had, say, two professors interested in cognitive science, I'm pretty sure they'd just stick them into the CS department and nobody would think that was strange or upsetting or crashing the party.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, though, I see researchers all over the computer science department that don't really have a place to participate, and the idea of making dozens of thin little sites to cover every possible ACM SIG strikes me as ignoring one of the great reasons that Stack Overflow succeeded in the first place: because we brought together &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; programmers to talk about code, and we created a reliable and robust tagging system so that you could quickly find the topics and people that you cared about, and because nobody minded (and many people enjoyed) the occasional brushing-of-shoulders with people who shared the same values but worked in different technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can we do something here? I think that sticking to &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; conversation is a great common denominator, but there are an awful lot of interesting topics that are excluded right now which could really use a home. See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;'s idea about what constitutes &quot;computer science&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence; Computation and Language; Computational Complexity; Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science; Computational Geometry; Computer Science and Game Theory; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computers and Society; Cryptography and Security; Data Structures and Algorithms; Databases; Digital Libraries; Discrete Mathematics; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Emerging Technologies; Formal Languages and Automata Theory; General Literature; Graphics; Hardware Architecture; Human-Computer Interaction; Information Retrieval; Information Theory; Learning; Logic in Computer Science; Mathematical Software; Multiagent Systems; Multimedia; Networking and Internet Architecture; Neural and Evolutionary Computing; Numerical Analysis; Operating Systems; Other Computer Science; Performance; Programming Languages; Robotics; Social and Information Networks; Software Engineering; Sound; Symbolic Computation; Systems and Control&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of that stuff is already on topic here, but a lot of it is sadly homeless in the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My belief is that broadening this site to &quot;computer science&quot; and allowing discussion on any &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; topic that fits in one of the arXiv categories of Computer Science (and possibly even using those categories as tags) would make this site grow quickly into a much larger and stronger resource that attracts people in computer science departments around the world, rather than a thinner site that attempts to stitch together just the purely theoretical disciplines. Of course through the use of tags and our tag following feature, every participant could define their own filtered view of what kinds of topics they are interested in following, but if you want to reach outside of your narrow research interest once in a while there will be lots of other interesting stuff going on here too.

Part of my skepticism is because of things I don't know and could be wrong about, and part of it is things I have experience with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major part of Joel's argument is that IRL, there aren't theoryCS departments, and so it's not unnatural to have generic CS departments here. I think that's exactly the wrong way of looking at the value of such sites. University departments are market-driven: they want to provide a generic-enough service to attract a large number of &quot;customers&quot;, while not watering down their mandate so much that they lose definition. They are also slow-moving lumbering beasts, so it takes a long time for them to evolve, and entrenched interests often prevent true change from coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But research communities form transversally: representatives of the community within departments meet up with each other, and as a lone theoretician, I can tell you that I find MUCH more community at conferences, and here, than in my home department. I think theoreticians would LOVE to have a theoryCS-only department (otherwise known as Princeton :)), but since that will never happen in the university environment, we are ecstatic to have it here. I would suspect this to be true for other subdisciplines in CS as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why isn't this the case in math ? it's because all mathematicians speak the same language and have the same overarching goals: to understand mathematical structures. CS subdisciplines don't have this common language: there are the electrical engineers, the software hackers, the AI researchers, the graphics/imaging folks, and then the mathematically minded theoryCS people. In fact, CS departments are making moves towards splits: witness Georgia Tech and CMU, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we could be a lot broader, and we need to work on that. But we have to be broader within theory. As Sylvain, Dave and Neel have argued, we need more theory B (logic, formal methods, programming languages). We also need more of the active researchers to show up here. I know many colleagues IRL who aren't here, and they should be. That's where I'd want to spend my efforts to make a community that I'd enjoy more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an argument that Joel makes regarding SO is that even if the communities are largely disjoint, the occasional serendipitous connection achieved from a merge might be worth it at little cost. I see how this happens on SO, and it might work here. However, there are many features of the site (most importantly reputation and the associated power that comes with it) that are global, and can easily get swamped by a few high popularity groups.

Topics don't simply disappear because people are also talking about related topics. The community doesn't let it. If the tag-set is strong, the subject stays strong. These sites scale wonderfully.

Your entire argument from value is based on the assertion that a large group has network effects that outweigh the niche community benefits we perceive here. The question is, for whom ? There's value for students who want to be exposed to the virtual university, but there isn't value for us, who want a community of our own: we get enough exposure to general CS in our departments, and many of us work a lot with outside groups (I have papers with DB, ML, vision, graphics and parallel folks, for example)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We've worked very hard to create what we have so far. And by no means are we done growing our community. It's a pity that the other area51 proposals haven't taken off: I don't know how well they've tried to proselytize, but I know that many of us worked very hard to get us over the definition and commit phases with relentless promotion.

I wanted to separate it out from the other discussion, though.  I'd like to start by contrasting two questions, one on StackOverflow, and one here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo&quot;&gt;How do I move the turtle in LOGO&lt;/a&gt;, especially the history of edits and closes.  A simple question with a simple answer, and, instead, it was repeatedly edited and closed by users who decided the question was fake, had nothing to do with programming, etc.  In this case, the asker was someone who wasn't leaving, so he clarified his position and eventually got an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now consider the question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/88/what-would-it-mean-to-disprove-church-turing-thesis&quot;&gt;disproving the Church-Turing thesis&lt;/a&gt;.  In this case, I answered the question, it received a lot of upvotes, and was accepted by the asker.  However, in the months since that occurred, some of the finest minds in TCS have commented or answered that question, both explaining how wrong I was, and also sharing deep insights about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question I'd like people to consider is: Would you rather have a culture of arrogance, in which anyone with enough rep can decide, &quot;Get real, you couldn't possibly be Donald Knuth, I'm closing your question,&quot; or would you rather have a culture in which leading researchers feel comfortable adding to a question where a fairly high rep user already posted an accepted answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question behind this question is, &quot;Why is there such a difference in the two sites?&quot;  I believe the answer lies in StackOverflow's fallacious belief that crowdsourcing is the best way to arrive at truth.  This may be the case for questions at the level of an Ask-the-Audience game show -- or even most in-the-trenches programming questions -- but when literally only a handful of people know the answer, and there are plenty of ways to deceive yourself that you solved the problem (when you didn't), the method breaks down.  Crowdsourcing does not produce truth; it only produces &lt;em&gt;an answer that nobody feels like debating any more&lt;/em&gt;.  This lack of debate might arise because everyone is convinced, or because the few people who know the real answer don't see the point of participating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suresh has made the point well that a one-size-fits-all perspective about StackExchange sites does not work.  However, I believe this argument does not go far enough.  The quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow would &lt;em&gt;significantly increase&lt;/em&gt; if that site were broken into smaller pieces.  If quality in answers is the priority, it should be harder than it currently is for C# experts to answer functional programming questions, as one example.  Rather than the academic caution that we have inherited -- not wanting to brashly say things about a field we know little about -- the StackOverflow model encourages people who get lots and lots of upvotes to answer questions in areas where there is little participation, because they'll get even more upvotes, and the people who know better aren't around, or don't want to start confrontation by calling them out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, on cstheory, if someone created a profile named &quot;Donald Knuth&quot; or &quot;Avi Wigderson&quot; or whoever, and asked a question, I bet everyone would be careful to treat that user like any other, and to treat the question professionally.  The content of the question is what is important, not &quot;making sure we're not being trolled&quot; or whatever.  I believe this attitude comes from our common belief in the importance of truth, as something beyond, &quot;Good enough,&quot; or, &quot;This is what works.&quot;  Moving forward, I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that we want to attract members who share that understanding of the primacy of mathematical truth.  That's what we share with others interested in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;StackExchange, of course, gets revenue as a function of number-of-hits, so I am sure they see the high traffic of StackOverflow as a great thing that should not be messed with by separating out pieces of it.  Ok, fine.  But if they are interested in more crossover among disciplines, they could, for example, institute a tag system that crosses sites.  So, for example, a chemist posting on biostar about the degree sequence of a molecular graph could see questions about degree sequences on cstheory -- and the graph theorist here could see a potential application for the theoretical work!  Personally, I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; such a feature.  I'd like to ask Joel Spolsky and Robert Cartaino to work on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, instead of asking us to adapt to the StackOverflow site model, which would not serve us well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="30" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T11:33:34.517" LastActivityDate="2011-02-10T17:06:23.427" Title="On the Difference between Crowdsourced Answers and Mathematical Truth" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="3" FavoriteCount="0" />

It is not just computer science proposals, I don't know &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; other scientific research level proposal that has got launched. We can discuss these things but I am strongly against making a decision too quickly. We should always have in mind what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were trying to achieve when we started this site and the effects any changes to the model will have on it. We want and need researchers on the site and anything which will have a negative effect on our ability to attract and maintain researchers is a bad thing. My personal opinion is that one of the reasons that cstheory got where it is right now is following a model on a related topic which has worked, i.e. MathOverflow, and we still haven't reached the place in Theory community that MathOverflow has in Math community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don't see what this is going to solve. Each area needs to attract researchers, putting all of those who are already there won't solve any problem. SE needs researchers in AI to answer AI questions and as long as they are not here nothing will change. I think all of the expected benefits of a unified site can be achieved by having multiple sites, one for each area and then having a unified &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; like the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; is unifying questions from many sites in one place (and nothing more like sharing reputation or votes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am also concerned about some of specific points of the proposal and the issues they can create, e.g. based on Physics.SE's experience, I am clearly against sharing reputation, especially if it is going to be shared with a non-research level questions/answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I don't think we have reached a state that we can relax and start to think about ways to modify the site, the site is just a few months old, many active research areas in theory are still heavily under-represented on cstheory, we should first get more researchers on those topics on cstheory before starting to worry about AI or Graphics or Systems. That is what we should focus on. The possible benefits of any modifications to cstheory are unclear in the best case and the possible negative consequences are considerable. I think we should wait for a year to let the site stabilize, changing things just a few months after cstheory's launch is not a good thing, we want to establish a brand in theory community, we have written a SIGACT article advertising the site just a few months ago to attract researchers in theory, any dramatic change will send the wrong signal to the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of cstheory as your company, would you make radical changes to its structure just after your first successful product is starting to get attention from consumers where the possible benefits of the changes are small/unclear and the risks are considerable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2011-02-14T16:03:34.720" CommentCount="3" />

Someone looking for an academic position, putting together a case for promotion in an academic position, or making an application for a research fellowship, cannot currently convert the time they spend on this site into significant practical benefit.  When asked whether a hiring committee would consider CSTheory participation of applicants, the blunt answer I have received has been: no.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It appears to me that people who are no longer in training, but have not yet become senior, cannot afford the time to contribute here, as the incentives are only there for junior and senior researchers.

Therefore tags look simply inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no advantage of having the corresponding CoRR subject area codes in the tags.  As I understand it, the only purpose of these codes is to indicate that they are area tags.  However, this is incomplete because not every area tag has a two-letter code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that a more consistent naming is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Stack Exchange server had a functionality of showing area tags in a different color, we would not have to distinguish them by names.  Because it does not have such a functionality, it is better to distinguish area tags by names.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I propose the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;.  Remove the &lt;code&gt;xx.&lt;/code&gt; part from the area tags of the form &lt;code&gt;xx.description&lt;/code&gt; and instead add a fixed prefix to all the area tags.  As the fixed prefix, I suggest to use either &lt;code&gt;a.&lt;/code&gt; (for “area”) or just &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;.  [&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: I removed the earlier suggestions &lt;code&gt;a:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; because it turned out that a colon cannot be used in tags.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2011-03-01T20:40:08.750" Title="Use a consistent prefix to distinguish area tags instead of CoRR subject area codes" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tags&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="26" />

This is against the policy about not allowing questions about unpublished not-peer-reviewed approaches to open problems and crank-friendly topics. The OP states that this is equivalent to &quot;$\mathbf{P}$ vs. $\mathbf{NP}$&quot;, and therefore it falls under that policy and should be closed as &lt;strong&gt;off-topic&lt;/strong&gt;. The cosmetics like the way of phrasing the question are irrelevant. In fact some users on Math.SE have advised the OP to phrase the question in that way to get around our policy, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/23850/are-there-any-known-barriers-to-some-approach-for-solving-p-vs-np&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you cross-post this question to CSTheory, it may not be well-received.

I feel that a website's URL is only an entry point and not really not important in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that people don't exchange URLs anymore in conversations (I remember that being the case when the Internet was younger). People will usually discuss a site and when asked for instructions will say &quot;Search for this term on your favourite search engine&quot;. On social media and blogs that are maintained by computer scientists, the link itself doesn't really matter, since people will just click on it and need not memorize it. It is not uncommon for the URL to be hidden behind a descriptive name, especially in blogs. If there is a problem with length, let each user deal with the url shortener services (e.g. for twitter). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After people have discovered the site and if they are really interested, they will make sure that they can come back. Personally, I used a bookmark in the early days, but usually I just type &quot;cst&quot; on my browser address bar and let my surf history take care of the rest. It happened that at times I completely forgot the URL after deleting my history, I simply searched for &quot;cstheory&quot; or &quot;cs stack exchange&quot; on my favourite search engine and there I was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we would see a better ROI if we tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search engine optimization&lt;/a&gt;, of course by benevolent techniques.

Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized.&lt;/strong&gt; The “email” tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentrate on what a tag means to your community.&lt;/strong&gt; For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail, as that would be more appropriate for webapps.stackexchange.com.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, what kinds of questions should have this tag? Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions, so if we don’t provide proper guidance on which questions need this tag, they won’t get tagged at all, rendering the tag excerpt moot.

So if we might mean just level 3 counts as research level, we might alternately say that levels 2 and 3 are appropriate to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But level 2 will also include some grad school problems and puzzles like the question that led to this thread.  Several people suggested that the motivation for a question might be used as a criteria to divide these level into worthy and unworthy.  The issue here is that we do not demand that the motivation be provided for questions, so we have to decide on the basis of what we see.  Thus as Marcus and others have said, judging motivation is problematic.

I suggest we work according to the following criterion: level 2 questions situated in the context of any research interest are on topic.  Level 2 questions that lack such motivation are in a grey area: we should encourage motivation, and we promise no consistency in the way we handle them.  These questions will be closed if there are five people with close powers who are bothered by the question.  It might be good to have a thread listing such closures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Large grey areas are not good, but I think it would be worse to bar good questions or stipulate the unworkable as criteria.

I think it will be too much work for moderators if low rep users start to comment in this way. Too much moderator intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was one of the people who have complained about the restriction previously, and don't think SE has a very good reasons for the restriction. But based on our experience so far, this restriction has not become a serious issue (I haven't seen anyone complain about this in recent months). My explanation is that those users who become part of the community easily gain the required 50 rep points by posting one or two answers, we get quite a number of question each day and expecting users to answer one or two question before being able to comment is not a strong requirement. So in practice the restriction is not as serious as it might seem at first. In other words, I also don't think there is a serious need for allowing low rep users to comment using answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Update:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify another point, I think there are legitimate cases where a user can use an answer to post a comment, e.g. the comment is too long for a comment. (I am also personally OK with any comment that is adding some new information in the direction of finding an answer, I consider them &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt; answers.) &#xA;And there are other cases where it is not legitimate (IMHO) like a one line question about the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand that the problem might be the following: my comment might mean to some users that answers should not be used as all to comment, where the FAQ entry only say that they &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be removed. So I think there might be a better way like posting a better comment that would not imply that commenting using answers is totally forbidden.

Due to the limited amount of discussion that can take place on this website, having a community blog with comment section would provide a good place for more subjective discussion. There are quite a few bloggers active on cstheory, so rather than posting only to the community blog, in my opinion it would be great if we could have some kind of cross-posting setup. This might be achieved, for example, from automatically reposting anything from specific blogs which are tagged 'cstheory-blog'. Alternatively if this is to complicated, then perhaps it could be done manually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that the scope be wider than that of the site.

However, we are capable of contributing useful content. A site like cstheory not only helps us learn answers to specific questions, it also teaches us how to ask interesting questions and provide useful answers.  I think a cstheory blog could help further this sort of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, if we proceed via Kaveh's suggestion of having a volunteer editorial board of experienced users, it would be nice if there was a method for more junior users to contribute posts for the consideration of the editorial board. Then the editorial board could skim/read the post and decide if it is interesting enough for the cstheory audience and if it is written at a professional enough level. I know that this would give me peace of mind, in that a more experienced researcher has looked at my writing and decided that it is not obviously stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already have this in place with publications. If I write a paper, I can first show it to my supervisor or more senior graduate students, and they provide the first level of security and feedback. However, if I wanted to contribute a post to the cstheory blog, I can't really take it to my adviser (especially if he doesn't use cstheory), so it would be nice if the community provided some sort of safety net.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside of course, is that this might put too much of a burden on the editorial board. However, if there is a flood of suggested posts then I am sure there are methods to prioritize (for instance you can use reputation or quality of answers/questions as a proxy for someone's expected question quality). The second downside is that the software might now allow us to easily submit posts for consideration - this depends on how the blog is implemented. I guess you could use Rob Simmons' approach of meta thread nomination, but I am a little wary of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1037" LastActivityDate="2011-07-10T07:48:17.750" CommentCount="2" />

To start with, we are happy to announce two editors-in-chief of the blog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/204/joe-fitzsimons&quot;&gt;Joe Fitzsimons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/30/aaron-sterling&quot;&gt;Aaron Sterling&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to manage content on the blog, and among their roles will be soliciting posts from YOU to place there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the second point. As currently envisaged (Joe and Aaron will have more to say on this I'm sure), anyone who's interested can contribute to the blog, and this is how it would work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you write a draft on the site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An editor reviews it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It gets posted. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presumably as time goes on, some contributors might get direct posting rights - we can see how that goes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what should you do now ? Sign up if you're interested in contributing. To do so, post your name and/or a link to your profile, which hopefully has an email address, in an answer below, and one of the admins (Kaveh or myself) will create an account for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once that's done, you can start writing drafts. And I'm sure the editors will nudge people as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about the format, content styles etc, please create a new meta question and link it here.

Maybe there should be a policy of deleting closed questions after a while? (Takes 3 votes from users with 10k reputation, which in practice means only moderators can delete questions.) Note that I'm just reminding of the possibility, I don't know if the policy would be good for CSTheory. A point in favor of deleting is that closed questions can give a wrong idea of the site (e.g. if most of the questions in a tag are closed, the tag looks more important than it should — and simply being there, because not everyone, especially visitors reaching the site from Google, pays attention to the closed status). Another point in favor of deleting off-topic questions is that the answers are often suspect because they haven't reached experts — but in CSTheory's case this may not apply so much, if the off-topic questions tend to be too elementary but nonetheless satisfactorily answered. A point against deletion is that closed questions can still have useful answers; an intermediate policy is to delete closed questions when it becomes clear that they haven't been reopened, unless they have answers with useful content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="634" LastActivityDate="2011-07-18T00:05:22.493" CommentCount="3" />

If you’re asking for a product recommendation of some kind, you want answers to contain detailed information about the features and how they can be used, and why you might want to choose one over the other. “How?” and “Why?” has more lasting value than a bunch of product-feature bullet points or a giant enumerated list, no matter how extensive. In contrast, the bad subjective questions let answerers get away with hit-and-run answers that maybe provide a name and a link — but fail to provide any sort of adequate explanation, context, or background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers.&lt;/strong&gt; The best subjective questions inspire your peers to share their actual experiences, not just post a mindless one-liner or cartoon in hopes of being rewarded with upvotes for being merely “first.” Sharing an experience takes at least one paragraph; ideally several paragraphs. If I’m asking about how to bake cookies, don’t give me a list of grocery items: milk. butter. vanilla. eggs. There is virtually nothing I can learn from a short, static list of grocery items that make up a recipe. Instead, tell me what happened the last time you made cookies from that recipe! Share your detailed experiences, so that we all might learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.&lt;/strong&gt; The best subjective questions avoid the all too seductive route of ranting and flamebait. They set the right tone of constructive learning and collaboration from the very outset, by emphasizing that we’re all here to learn from each other, even if we have different viewpoints or beliefs about the right way to handle what are inherently subjective decisions. We’re not here to fight each other; that’s an enormous waste of everyone’s time. There is always more than one right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly experiences inform opinions, but the best subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing actual experiences over random opinions. It’s more useful to share with us what you’ve done than what you think. Everyone has an opinon. It takes zero effort or imagination to have an opinion about anything and everything. But people who have done things, real things in the world, and have the scars and arrows in their back to show for it — now that’s worth sharing. You should be uniquely qualified to have your opinion based on the specific experiences you had. And you should share those experiences, and more specifically what you learned from your experiences, with us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.&lt;/strong&gt; Opinion isn’t all bad, so long as it’s backed up with something other than “because I’m an expert”, or “because I said so”, or “just because”. Use your specific experiences to back up your opinions, as above, or point to some research you’ve done on the web or elsewhere that provides evidence to support your claims. We like you. We want to believe you. But like wikipedia itself, {{citation needed}}. And good subjective questions make this clear from the outset: back it up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun.&lt;/strong&gt; The best subjective questions avoid the social pitfalls of “Getting To Know You” (GTKY) and mindless entertainment. Sometimes people just want to poll a community for ideas that might help solve a problem (best book, best approach). These can be okay when there is actual knowledge in the collection of answers. What isn’t okay are the social bonding questions which are designed just to impress others, such as “What is the coolest/stupidest/weirdest/funniest thing you saw/did/tasted today?”, or questions where the site’s actual topic is tacked on as a token afterthought, such as “Favorite food for programmers.” If you removed the “for programmers” part of this question, is it really unique to our profession? Could an average member of our community reasonably be expected to learn something that makes them better at their job from this question? If not, then it’s a bad subjective question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2011-07-29T18:52:38.820" CommentCount="9" />

Thus, it is important to understand the difference between quantum and classical random walks. Sometimes, the easiest way to do this is to consider toy models, such as walks on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, I think there are enough quantum folks at cstheory that I might get a very good answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the question is clearly physics-y and would be of little interest to non-quantum cstheory members.

The simplest example off the top of my head is the&#xA;  longest substring of ones in a 0,1 string.

Sorry for the delay, Artem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, my personal blog, Nanoexplanations, has been registered at ResearchBlogging.org for a few months now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short answer&lt;/strong&gt;: YES, it would be a good idea to submit an application there to add the community blog.  This will require adding at least one new category to the blog, and posts in that category will require additional logistics to submit.  We gain broader traffic and higher pagerank.  (The pagerank thing is nothing to sneeze at, btw.  I just googled &quot;Valiant Turing lecture,&quot; and my blog entry about the lecture came back higher-ranked than the ACM video of the lecture itself (!?!).  My post that day is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; aggregated by ResearchBlogging; but the blog itself has been pumped up by being linked to many other science sites.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longer answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Artem's characterization of researchblogging.org is not quite correct.  For information about the application process, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/static/index/page/adduser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;; the guidelines for a post that can be aggregated by their service are &lt;a href=&quot;http://researchblogging.org/news/?p=53&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TooLongDidn'tReadTheLinks&lt;/strong&gt;: For a post to qualify, it must thoughtfully discuss archived, peer-reviewed research.  Papers on ECCC or the ArXiv are in a grey area; they may qualify if the discipline's subculture means putting them there is tantamount to publishing.  There is a flagging system, and blogs have been removed from the service, for citing publications and then just regurgitating the abstract, etc.  (I've seen one blog disappear myself.)  The blog post must contain original work.  In particular, the technical introduction posts we have published so far &lt;em&gt;do not qualify&lt;/em&gt; as far as I am concerned, because there is not enough in-depth discussion of any single reference -- the posts are valuable to the community, but are &quot;stitched-together abstracts&quot; from multiple sources.  This is not intended to denigrate the Technical Intros in any way; I like those posts a lot, I am only saying it is not what ResearchBlogging.org is looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;: We should continue posting as we are posting -- Answer of the Week, Technical Introduction, Conference/Workshop Reports, and occasional blog announcements -- and also add an additional category.  I am open to suggestions about the name, but as a first thought, I will propose, &quot;Research.&quot;  Such posts will have at least one, and at most three, citatations, and will discuss the content of the paper(s) in depth, perhaps both strengths and weaknesses, and preferably conclude by pointing to open problems.  Think the Lipton blog, or writing a conference review when you are not anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;: multiple authors can register on a single blog, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchblogging.org/static/index/page/adduser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  If this is something the community wants, I will (apply to) register the blog, and others can add as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Known bugs&lt;/strong&gt;: (1) A password only works once.  You need to reset your password every time you want to log in. Also, don't close the window until you are completely done.  (2) The blog scanner is very slow, when it works at all.  Once a post is uploaded, wait five minutes, then manually go into settings and rescan the blog yourself.  These &quot;fixes&quot; were suggested to me by Dave Munger, director of ResearchBlogging.org.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found that being registered there was good for my writing and my own blog.  It forced me to post less often and to take what I wrote more seriously, because I wanted the post to be aggregated.  I have fallen off the wagon recently, because I have been posting to promote the community blog.

Unlike Suresh, this does bother me. When I only have time to read a few questions, I use the author gravatar as a guide in helping me select which questions to read (maybe I am not suppose to do this, but then why are they so prominently displayed?). It is always a disappointment when I come to the question and realize it is actually a very basic question asked by somebody else and the person I trust just edited the tags. In fact for some frequent editors, I have started effectively ignoring their name when it shows up in the author field. Thus, I contribute to the damage of proactive behavior, by effectively punishing frequent editors (people who contribute to the community greatly) by affording them less of my mind share when selecting questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would really like to see a minor edit checkbox like we have for wikipedia. If I flip the checkbox, then my name does not displace the authors (or last editors) name as the name associated with a question on the front page. This is not only a nice feature for the concern in Jukka's question, it is also simply more honest! If I edited the tags of a question, or went in and changed their math to proper LaTeX, then I haven't actually contributed to the ideas of the question.

The quality of posts so far has been excellent, from a diverse group of people, and as I write this, there are at least three posts in the pipeline to be written by contributors (i.e., not by the blog editors), so in that sense participation is good.  Where we are falling down is that we are not being read by people outside of CSTheory itself, and the number of hits per day from internet searches is very low.  I believe the second one is due to low blog pagerank, because my personal blog, which is updated far less often, gets much more traffic from searches (not counting searches for topical things like the hacker group Anonymous, which I have mentioned on my blog, but is not mentioned in the community blog).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see the following steps we can take.  Some Joe and I can just do, but others we need help on.  Also, I'd very much like to hear the ideas of others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve once and for all our participation in the TOC Blog Aggregator.&lt;/strong&gt;  Once again, our post is not appearing there.  I have no idea what the deal is, but this one step would double our traffic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce a couple static pages with useful community content.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have some time this weekend, and I will put together the page on theoretical computer science conferences, now that the community wiki question I asked to gather that information has stabilized.  &lt;em&gt;Perhaps someone else could volunteer to produce a page on links to career advice, and other such resources?&lt;/em&gt;  (If no one does, I will eventually get to it, but it might take a whiiiiile.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully flesh out the blogroll and links of the blog.&lt;/strong&gt;  This includes having updates of other blogs when they put up a new post (so not just the names of the blogs, but one line snapshots into their content).  Point being: there is a reason for a reader to stop by, even if we have not put up a new post in a few days.  This also has the perhaps-more-important effect of making the blog appear more professional.  (An Admin might have to do this step, not sure whether Joe and I can.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the design so it looks professional and not tacky as hell.&lt;/strong&gt;  Part of the reason that I am disappointed we're not being picked up by the TOC Aggregator is that I much prefer reading posts on the Aggregator.  The current sketchy non-design of our blog is not friendly to my eyes.  Do we need to deal with SE on this?

  <row Id="1349" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2011-09-27T15:40:06.383" Score="3" ViewCount="123" Body="&lt;p&gt;First, let me point out that a viewer's needs and actions are fundamentally different when viewing CSTheory and when reading the blog.  Most of the questions posted on CSTheory are a few short paragraphs in length (or less), and require only a couple minutes to read, though they may inspire a lot of thinking time.  By contrast, our blog posts are averaging over 1200 words each, or in one case much longer, and the technical introductions have been conceptually dense, requiring re-reading sections more than once in order to digest the material.  Also, people have been posting in meta about starting polymath projects, or posting for ResearchBlogging.org, either of which would be likely to increase blog entry length, as well as density of content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it would be quite surprising if the same page format were ideal for both the blog and CSTheory, given such different user experiences -- and, in fact, the same format is not ideal for the blog.  The current design of the blog violates universally accepted industry best practices.  I will start with those, move to a suggestion based on personal taste, and finish by pointing out an issue (math rendering) for which I believe no great solution yet exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Industry Best Practices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters per line:&lt;/strong&gt; Different sources differ, but all agree on the following range: a blog should have 50-75 characters per line.  (One link &lt;a href=&quot;http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)   The blog currently has about 95 characters per line.  This is consistent with the CSTheory site, but not consistent with blog readability.  I see no reason to change the Q&amp;amp;A site, but I suggest we change the blog line width to 60 characters.  Just this step alone would dramatically improve readability and the blog design would still be reminiscent of the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web fonts:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no longer any reason to put up with Lucida Sans UTC-8 when publishing content.  Professionally-designed web font services allow for a much more legible, and beautiful, reading experience.  The only webfont service I have used directly is &lt;a href=&quot;http://typekit.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt;, which would be free for us, since they offer a free package to users with less than 25,000 views a month.  There are at least a few alternative companies as well.  Also, Typekit provides close relatives to Lucida Sans, like Luxi Sans, so the blog would remain in theme with the main site, while the readability would improve dramatically if we installed one or two web fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line rules and boxes to texturize the space:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an area where the main site is currently much better designed than the blog.  If you look at right hand column of the main site, you will see two input boxes at the top, an information box about the chatroom below that, information in a special meta color about meta below that, a blue-background section below that, and a list of (boxed) tags below that.  By contrast, the texture of the right sidebar of the blog is essentially identical to that of the blog entries themselves.  As a result, the page appears washed out, because there is no delineation between one type of content and another.  So in this case, I think the blog should look much more like the main site.  Perhaps the fix here is as simple as arranging plugins in a particular order, so they appear usefully in the sidebar.  But, for example, the Twitter feed could appear in a blue-bordered box with the official Twitter logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Personal taste&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both the blue and the black are too white:&lt;/strong&gt; I think if we deal with the above issues, that will solve almost all the problems, but another thing that concerns me is the flatness of the color scheme.  This is particularly an issue with the black letters in the blog entries.  Again, the main site is better here than the blog.  If you compare the same letters on both sites, they are rendered more &quot;blackly&quot; and less pixelated on CSTheory than on the blog.  This particular issue would be solved with a web font, but overall I would prefer more contrast between the colors of the letters and the background color.  For example, I think the blue in the article titles should be darker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Something to think about&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math rendering:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't believe there exists a great math rendering package for the web right now, but, even so, I would like to raise the point that we don't need to be using MathJax.  I don't have a better suggestion, though.

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.  I do not like the opening after the edit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is always a way for application in topics related to theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the intent of the edit which Kaveh explained, this does not sound like a professional to me.  Instead, it sounds like some newbie who tries to pretend to be a professional.  Frankly speaking, the question sounded at least honest before the edit, but it sounds pretentious after the edit.  I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it should be pointed out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306&quot;&gt;we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question&lt;/a&gt;: we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.  If you do it, you should do it right.  I guess that it is a perfectly reasonable choice to give up such a difficult task and just either leave the question open or close it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2011-11-02T19:36:12.897" CommentCount="0" />

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;amp;A sites which have a more general scope like &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Math.SE&lt;/a&gt; that would welcome questions from students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes&quot;&gt;your question&lt;/a&gt; is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ps:&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking&quot;&gt;this section of the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and also the pages linked there.

Or Stack Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do some research.&lt;/strong&gt; What is this conference about? When is it? How many people? What are the costs involved? What are your opportunities for speaking, giving away swag, or otherwise raising awareness of your site?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rally support.&lt;/strong&gt; Bring your ideas to the community. Explain why “this is a good idea, we should do this!” Be really specific and persuasive, and make sure you encourage feedback and ideas. We’ll be looking to this meta thread when deciding which conferences and activities are worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring it to our attention.&lt;/strong&gt; If the idea has merit and community support, ping us with the details and participants to community@stackexchange.com.

This means the initial asking of a question, any time a question gets a new answer, and any edit made to any post. This is reflected by showing who the source of said activity was. On other pages (like on Searches, or with the &lt;code&gt;newest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;votes&lt;/code&gt;, and similar sorts), we display the original author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; sort retained its recent-activity-sort, but the time stamp and author instead reflected the original author of the question, then the order of posts on the page would be unintuitive. Even if the sort order was known (which, thankfully, the tooltip explains), you are left without a means of knowing what the activity was, or who was behind it. This is counter to the purpose of that sorting, which is explicitly &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; draw attention to the activity and who was behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast the &lt;code&gt;faq&lt;/code&gt; sort, which does display the original author. Putting aside the incredibly vague tooltip, there isn't any data on the page to explain the sort order, making it equally unintuitive. However, the focus of the page is on the questions themselves for being asked very often. The raw link data isn't quite all that important, compared to the intended convenience of being able to quickly find questions to use for frequent duplicate closures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As recommended in the comments, I suggest using the &lt;code&gt;newest&lt;/code&gt; sort if you want to watch for potential new questions from users you respect or admire. Active sort is intended to point out when people post new answers or make changes to posts, and noting who and when it was (and, on the front page, linking directly to that activity via time stamp) is very conducive to the intent of that sort method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6115" LastActivityDate="2011-11-30T16:06:33.037" CommentCount="9" />

I don't think it is a good way of using the site. cstheory is a Q&amp;amp;A site with a specific scope. If you have a question which can be answered by (say) a good typical undergraduate student then it is probably out-of-scope here. Think of asking questions on cstheory as asking questions from other grad students/colleagues/your advisor. If you don't feel good about asking a question from them off-line then with good probability it is not a suitable question for cstheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble in reading/writing English, then you should work on improving them. There are SE sites related to English and you can try getting help there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if while reading a paper you face a question and after spending a reasonable time still can't understand it then I think that can be turned into a reasonable cstheory question.

Since many of the questions of this nature that people post have quick answers, the chat system enables that quick back-and-forth&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Participation is 'opt-in': since the chat system isn't front and center, there's no danger that people uninterested in answering such questions might be forced to wade through pages and pages to get to the 'research-level' questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One fear that we've had in the past with allowing lower-level questions is that we'd get swamped with such questions and that things like reputation counts and question scores would get biased towards answering such questions.

Replying to abusive, off-topic, or inappropriate content only encourages it – whereas flagging allows removal without providing undue attention. &#xA;  Post related to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/conventions-on-downvoting&quot;&gt;conventions on downvoting&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;  Which suggest that flagging is the best thing to do when you thing a post does not match the standards we expect. However, declined flags get a preventive remark:&#xA;  Flag declined - flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which suggests that flagging may flood moderators. Then I thought, maybe it is better that users control content by voting up/down. But whenever you vote down you see a pop-up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please consider adding a comment if you think this post can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, try to make constructive suggestions.

A flag is a direct line to the mods, and should be used for things that are egregious and require immediate attention (like explicitly offensive behaviour). Otherwise, posts that deserve to be closed eventually do get closed by community voting - it might not happen as fast as one would like, but it's a community call. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that voting down a post is (eventually) as effective as closing.

So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been observed, our overall participation numbers have slowed, as well as the pace of new &lt;em&gt;upvoted&lt;/em&gt; questions. Given how many people I personally know who &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; active on the site, I see no reason why our numbers should be slowing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My view of the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are not the same as the mathoverflow community. TCS is much smaller to start with, and there's a much smaller gap between the &quot;starting grad student question&quot; and &quot;advanced research question&quot; in TCS than in math. By limiting ourselves to the research end of the spectrum, we are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain. This is often mitigated by reputation (I might be able to get away with asking a basic complexity theory question), but it shouldn't be !&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;spending far too much time policing the boundaries of what's acceptable, instead of being willing to accept some small fraction of lower-level questions in order to also bring in more interesting ones. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A proposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should allow questions that might be asked by a grad student in a grad theory class, even if they are not 'research-level', as long as they are looking for a deeper understanding. For example, a question &quot;What is Sauer's lemma' could be dismissed because it's on Wikipedia, but &quot;How should I go about proving an upper bound on VC dimension&quot; would be ok. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not perfect as examples go, and I'm happy to hear modifications and suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But please keep the discussion constructive and focused. Just because your questions are closed doesn't mean that there's a problem.

Any suggestions on how to solve it?&quot; Answer: &quot;This is NP-complete using the following simple reduction from longest path. However, you could try the following heuristics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any problem that is a simple reduction from longest path might be an assignment problem in an undergrad course. So if this were asked by an undergrad, we should close it. But Peter suggests that it should be kept open if asked by a practitioner outside the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: This issue is not resolved. I don't think people are in agreement about what to do about this or how to distinguish whether the OP is an undergrad or a practitioner in another field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Issue 3: Grad level questions: Should we lower the bar from &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;grad-level&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are questions that would be considered basic grad level in field X by persons who study field X.

But let's assume that questions come from grad students in the field so as to not confuse this issue with Issue 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions might be homework questions for grad courses (which means they can be difficult questions) or questions asked by grad students to the instructor during/after class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this issue separates into two issues. The first is about grad-level homework questions and the second is about questions asked by a grad student, which are not research-level, but the answer can be found in a grad-level text book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently I don't think there is consensus on this.

Because in the end, whatever we do, we have to do it for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, why change the scope at all?

I fail to see how you could get experts from other fields engaged here.

This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="634" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:48:30.257" LastActivityDate="2012-08-12T23:30:32.150" CommentCount="1" />

In such cases, users may prefer one site over another depending on the type of answer they want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, I am a mathematical logician, so my relation with TCS is mostly tangential. As a result, my knowledge of the field is very uneven. It's fairly common for me to encounter something in TCS that I don't know but is not necessarily that high-level, something that a young graduate student in TCS may ask. However, the student and I need very different types of answer to this question. On the one hand, a carefully crafted and detailed answer makes a lot of sense for the student since they are seeking to learn more and hone their skill set. On the other hand, a brief explanation skipping over routine steps is perfect for me. I really just need to plug a gap in my knowledge base, my general skills are already well developed so I can easily fill in the missing steps. Even if the question is the same, it's better for me to ask it here and it's better for the student to ask elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the scope of this site should allow this kind of flexibility. It wouldn't hurt to be explicit about this in the statement of purpose. This is also a good place to remind users to add motivation and background for their question. Otherwise, it's very difficult for the community to assess whether this is the right place for a borderline question. This is difficult, but it's not a bad idea to try to cultivate a certain level of tolerance for questions that are not clearly out of scope.

looking into &amp;amp; even veering towards myself &amp;amp; its key to this group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this question is probably a little too hypothetical. in principle you could build a paper by stringing together some stackexchange answers but it would be unusual. as mod kaveh writes, each question must stand on its own separate merit and also note, few people regularly post questions here or with high frequency esp those with high rep, and there is some possibility that frequent questions are actually informally frowned on via the voting mechanisms &amp;amp; current collective voting tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the pattern is more in general that high rep users answer random newcomer questions. also, it is unlikely that you would get solid answers to all the separate (presumably nontrivial) questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;basically yes, that is part of the &lt;em&gt;raison d'etre&lt;/em&gt; of the group, to occasionally collaboratively generate scientific research to theoretical computer science in general &amp;amp; complexity theory in particular (complexity theory entries even were once highlighted here in css formatting). however the conventions around this are new &amp;amp; still being established as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1st, use the stackexchange search engine highly extensively and also the tag system, both can be very effective. find every relevant post to your paper or subject. figure out the best knowledge that is posted on the group. figure out the border between the known and unknown and what is posted vs not posted. this also requires close familiarity with nearby papers. it helps to bookmark or &quot;favorite&quot; all related posts on here &amp;amp; elsewhere. use the related posts column on the right also. mix this with heavy cross use of google. in some cases you may find an expert on here posting on the subj. you can look at their own answers &amp;amp; look at their papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;next, try posting a single carefully crafted question totally centered on your subject and your paper and what you're thinking of establishing. its a delicate mix between the general (background) and the specific (the new result/concept you're aiming for). as if you have a single chance to ask the experts what you'd most want to know but what you also most think they'd be able to answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;responses will help you figure out what is known by the crowd but also how relevant it is to this group based on reaction in form of comments, enthusiasm, voting, etc. it has to be at a &quot;just right difficulty&quot; between too easy [not research] and too hard [you wont get replies/answers]. it takes some time to find that balance &amp;amp; its an ongoing challenge. dont assume that if there is a good answer, someone will post it. dont assume that if people post answers, those are the best possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you will prob find if you are very focused that there are two gaps. one is the gap between what you want to establish in your paper and what is established in related literature. the other gap is what you can actually find out by using this group (both by searching it and posting questions). these two gaps are interrelated. you can judge whether you can build on all this with meaningful new results. but those key results will basically have to be generated by you, nobody else, unless you have found &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; collaborators in your own professional circles. you can use other results as a &quot;jumping off&quot; point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so finally, leverage everything youve found and write a paper. if the answers on stackexchange are very notable and innovative, you can cite them in your paper using the stackexchange urls/&quot;cite&quot; feature. this is really not much different than citing blogs, which is occasionally done in real scientific papers. however note that this is somewhat problematic because content on here can disappear very easily due to voting, moderators, users [who can delete stuff] etc...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;probably the best and most successful model of all this invented so far is polymath[3] with a difficult problem and published arxiv paper to its credit but keep in mind this is a project started by a field medalist Gowers and promoted by his friends eg Tao and Kalai who are also very elite/accomplished theorists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-will-you-cite-a-discussion-on-this-site-in-your-paper&quot;&gt;How will you cite a discussion on this site in your paper?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188/how-can-we-collaboratively-investigate-open-problems?rq=1&quot;&gt;How can we collaboratively investigate open problems?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1731&quot;

  <row Id="1619" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2012-12-10T14:51:54.630" Score="8" ViewCount="249" Body="&lt;p&gt;As it is December 2012, we are now going to reset our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;script packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be &lt;strong&gt;220 x 250 pixels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1619&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6115" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2013-10-05T03:03:38.283" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2013" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="2" FavoriteCount="2" ClosedDate="2013-12-06T10:21:45.410" CommunityOwnedDate="2012-12-10T14:51:54.630" />

My view of its proper use would include giving background to the result or other subject matter which the reference refers to, motivating why the subject itself is interesting to look into. However, that's also my opinion regarding all questions. Simply asking &quot;I need a reference for problem X&quot; seems on a par for brusqueness as simply asking &quot;Can we detect jeejaws in 2-whatsis-graphs in $O(n^{3.1})$ time?&quot; without further elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a field as broad and sometimes as particular as Theoretical Computer Science, even those who mostly ask questions can provide value for the website by adding context so that those unfamiliar with a particular subject can learn something new from the question alone.

Scott Aaronson in his blog sometimes uses the scenario of super-intelligent alien beings having a discussion with us to emphasise the universality of certain notions in mathematics or computer science. This post felt like a very scaled-down but realistic form of that thought experiment. A person from a different, but closely related field comes to us and says, &quot;we do logic, you do logic, and we have all these cool results, but what do you have to show for your logic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to tell from the wording how deep the author's knowledge of classical mathematical logic is, but the question does request for answers that appeal to advanced logical concepts. I was absolutely gung-ho about writing an answer because questions that specifically want and advanced-level survey are rare. A couple of hours later, I realised that this was never going to end. I'm glad to see that the question has now been made community wiki. I think my current answer is too long and should be split into different answers. I have three concrete proposals for answers to that question. Please let me know if you agree with these proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/em&gt;. Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph give a high-level overview of the field aimed at researchers in mathematics or TCS. The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/em&gt;. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 3.&lt;/em&gt; If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective.

However, from answerer’s viewpoint, I think that it is better to post a new answer to the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; question or edit an answer to the old question rather than posting an answer to the new question, because it is the same question and it is just a better answer.  Therefore, I think that in this situation, the new question should be closed as a duplicate for the old question.

If the user has enough rep points, he/she can edit a post.  Add a tag or correct a typo or make some other harmless edit, and the question is bumped on the top page and it receives some attention.  Proposing an edit has one obstacle, but if the proposed edit is accepted, it has the same effect.  But either way, this sounds like an abusive or spam-like activity to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is to bring this up in chat room.  Problems are that it is usually not active, and that if the user is new, he/she cannot post a message in chat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is bounty, but this requires some rep points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2013-02-11T04:39:43.540" Title="How to ask for a clearer answer to an old question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;asking-questions&gt;&lt;exact-duplicates&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="3" />

One should abuse the fact that experts and researchers read cstheory to promote and advertise personal opinions and claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think cstheory is not and should not become a medium for non-experts to express such claims and ideas, that is not a goal of the site and frequency of such posts would hinder the usefulness of the site for its target community.

In the case of the above question, here's what my personal (i.e non-moderator) take is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question rambles terribly and doesn't really get to the point&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the poster has a habit of writing questions and answers like this, and frequently gets downvoted/otherwise censured for such postings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But in this case, another user has suggested a concrete improvement that can be made, and there are a number of upvotes (and faves) for the question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the moderator role here is to help suggest modifications (especially since there appears to be a germ of substance in the question) and encourage the OP to make the changes (which I will note the OP has &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; done). As an individual, the moderator is free to downvote the post in its current form. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as a community moderator, I prefer to do nothing rather than do something, and in this case I have to ask what the consequences are of doing nothing. Either the OP will fix the post or not. If not, it's quite likely that other members of the community will downvote the post and/or vote to close it. Or they might attempt to answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;worst case scenario&quot; from my point of view might be that an ill-formed question sticks around for a while. But what is the downside of this ? The OP regularly posts ill-formed questions, and they get hammered (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/7884/vzn?tab=questions&amp;amp;sort=votes&quot;&gt;about 2/3 of the questions posted&lt;/a&gt; have a net negative score). Clearly the OP is not learning anything from the community view on their question formulation, but I don't see any evidence that these questions are affecting others, or reducing the quality of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are sufficiently many options available to the community at large that I (as moderator) don't need to step in.

I am ambivalent about its appropriateness. Ill formed questions appear occasionally on this site. I myself have posted a question that was sub-optimal for the site, and was glad that the community engaged me and pointed out why my question was inappropriate rather than closing it. I believe the community has tolerated and helped to improve vague, unclear, but well intentioned questions. Even if intent is unclear, we have helped improve unclear questions. I feel that this question can easily be improved to a clear, technical question and ideally, I would prefer this route. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am aware that the OP is very unlikely to incorporate feedback from the community and improve the question. I agree that this is a problem and sympathise with the frustration of both the site users, and particularly moderators who must confront such issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I would prefer to be part of a relaxed community. This is a personal preference. I am averse to forums that feature flame wars, heavy moderation and contentious discussions that essentially amount to shouting contests for intellectual bullies. I would like this site to have an image that is welcoming and not intimidating to give computer scientists the confidence that they can ask questions and be listened to rather than fear admonishment if their query does not satisfy some rigid set of rules. Let me clarify that I am currently fairly happy with this site and I do not believe any of the concerns I am stating currently apply. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing a question so quickly, especially when it is not obvious why (to me as a user, viewing the question) feels strong to me. I would have preferred for the community to go through the potentially futile process of suggesting improvements and then either expressing our displeasure with our votes, or ignoring the question beyond a point. To Kaveh, I would like to further add that this is a preference of mine, not a strong opinion. My desire for a relaxed environment and concern that closing a few questions quickly will cause us to descend into a dictatorship is less realistic than your concern that the site will attract cranks, but neither concern seems empirically justified. In the latter case, you may have more information as a moderator and if people are indeed being driven away by cranks I would agree that we should behave proactively. This concern does not seem to apply to this question because the user in question has been on the site for a while and the community has survived. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regarding improving the question itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is one potential wording. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is about the combinatorial structure of resolution proofs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let $Prop$ be a set of atomic propositions. A &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; is an atomic proposition or its negation. A clause is a disjunction of literals. Let $Clause$ be the set of clauses over $Prop$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;resolvent&lt;/em&gt; of two clauses $C \lor p$ and $\neg p \lor D$ with &lt;em&gt;pivot&lt;/em&gt; $p$ is the clause $C \lor D$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;resolution proof&lt;/em&gt; is a finite, labelled DAG $P = (V, E, piv, clause)$, where &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$(V,E)$ is a graph in which vertices have in-degree $0$ or $2$, and vertices with in-degree $0$ are called &lt;em&gt;leaves&lt;/em&gt; and those with in-degree $2$ are called &lt;em&gt;internal vertices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$piv$ is a function from internal vertices to atomic propositions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$clause: V \to Clause$ is a function satisfying that for all internal vertices $w$ with incoming edges from $u$ and $v$, $clause(w)$ is the resolvent of $clause(u)$ and $clause(v)$ with pivot $pivot(w)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A clause $C$ is derived by resolution from a set of clauses $F$ if there exists a resolution proof $P$ in which $clause(v)$ is $C$ for some vertex $v$ and every leaf vertex on a path to $v$ is labelled with a clause from $F$. A &lt;em&gt;resolution refutation&lt;/em&gt; is a derivation of the empty clause.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original questions can be reformulated as below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;For every DAG $G$, does there exist a resolution proof $P$ whose underlying graph is isomorphic to $G$?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;For every DAG $G$, does there exist a resolution refutation $P$ whose underlying graph is isomorphic to $G$?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does there exist an ordering on clauses such that the set of clauses labelling leaves is minimal with respect to that ordering?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me point out that I believe  (1) and (2) are directly in the question and (3) includes a minor interpretation on my part. I would further extend (3) as below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;3'. If $E$ and $F$ are sets of clauses, define the order $E \le F$ if for every clause $C$ in $E$ there exists a clause $D$ in $F$ such that every literal in $C$ occurs in $D$. For every DAG $G$, does there exist a proof $P$ such that the clauses labelling leaves are minimal with respect to this order. Is there a unique minimum labelling? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My reformulation does leave open whether the question is research level. I believe the reformulated question is not difficult to answer, but I find it appropriate for this site. The proof required would be a background exercise for approaching the type of work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bureshop/resolution.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The complexity of resolution refinements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4155" LastActivityDate="2013-02-18T05:06:46.660" CommentCount="10" />

I usually try to even phrase such comments carefully and conditionally so the OP can reply and clarify that I misunderstood and that would be fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I have expressed the following before (probably as a reply to Peter in some meta discussion). I agree that there are some very knowledgeable users on cstheory who can write very deep and interesting answers even to very simple questions. I don't have an issue with this by itself and I even enjoy reading such answers. But I think you would agree with me that we have to draw a line &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; for separating on-topic from off-topic (it doesn't need to be very rigid and black and white but it should be clear when some questions is really off-topic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that following what you are suggesting we should not close any question, even very basic ones, because someone might be able to write a very deep answer (independent of what its author was looking for). I am not sure if even very simple standard undergraduate textbook exercises can be closed then as I am not sure that no one can write a deep answer to such questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put it in another way, my issue is this: where do we draw the line? You or some other user might like a question and might want to write or read a deep answer to it, but I can't read minds or future. I need something more concrete that I can base decisions on. I can't tell a user whose question is closed that another similar question is left open because someone wanted to write a deep answer to it although it has similar level. I don't mind if we relax where we draw the line, but I need it to be reasonably clear to be able act based on it and also categorize as off-topic those questions which others consider to be really off-topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ps: if you or someone else edits an off-topic question and makes it on-topic that can be fine. However, IIRC, we had a discussion about this long time ago and the result was that if someone has a related interesting question they should post it as a new question. I personally don't edit such question except in very special cases for two reasons: 1. I don't think it is good to edit someone else's question so much that it is not what its author is looking for. 2.

The question is certainly broad, but I wouldn't speculate on the motives or expertise level of the questioner. It's &lt;strong&gt;likely&lt;/strong&gt; that they don't have much background, but so what ? I face this kind of question in my graduate algorithms class all the time, and as JeffE points out, it's really a tricky question with very different answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the very idea that you need to fix a model to even talk about lower bounds is not at all obvious to students who haven't been steeped in theory for a while. It's possible to go through an undergraduate degree in CS at a reasonable place, learn that &quot;sorting takes n log n time&quot;, and never really confront what this means until you hit grad school. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, there are questions where the questioner has little background and the answer is quite trivial. But then there are questions where the questioner has little background and the answer is highly nontrivial. I agree with JeffE that this is a good chance to &quot;blow the questioner's mind&quot; with some truly deep ideas that theoreticians have developed over the years, as well as create a general reference answer that others will be able to Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One issue that might have been raised with this is &quot;well, let's let it go on cs.SE and it can be answered there&quot;.

In other words, the fact that this question &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; be answered in some form on cs.SE shouldn't disqualify it from being answered here, and in fact for this particular question I think we are the more appropriate forum for expert answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2013-07-19T05:25:33.713" CommentCount="2" />

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One recent example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&quot;&gt;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&lt;/a&gt;.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).

For example, there are a a few ways in which one is NOT allowed to prove a P vs NP statement, and a serious proof attempt will at least make some attempt to address this issue first. But to even understand the forbidden proof methods takes a lot of background reading (for example the Arora/Barak book). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Kaveh is correct in asserting that while the P vs NP &lt;strong&gt;statement&lt;/strong&gt; might be accessible to the layman, any claimed proof is unlikely to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2013-09-09T06:47:19.990" CommentCount="7" />

When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; question in &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; computer science.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;script packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Some students might want to browse the site to decide if TCS is right for them.  Some researchers might use it as an occasional resource.  Others feel the site gives them a community they otherwise wouldn't have.  All of these seem to be valid roles for the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would resolve the flags as appropriate and comment on their inappropriate posts explaining why they are against the policy/spirit of the site.  If that doesn't help, my next steps would very much depend on the reason for the large number of flags.  If their intentions seemed genuine, I would be patient. But if it were clear, for instance, that the user is just insulting people for fun or to troll, I would consider suspending them for a period of time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would contact the mod privately and discuss with them.

It would be great if most TCS researchers joined this site and participated.  However, the site's role in the community may evolve organically, as these things often do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem.

Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly by its own merits.  If you know that the person asking the question is, for example, a famous researcher, then it makes sense to re-evaluate the question with this in mind.  But a bad question is a bad question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators basically should try to keep the site running smoothly with as little intervention as possible.

(Though if I were running the stackexchange site, I might have chosen a different design decision.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The software makes moderator votes immediately binding, so this lets them resolve egregious issues more quickly.  Of course moderators also have access even 20k users do not.  However, more importantly, because moderators are elected by the community, they can speak for the community in a way high rep users cannot.  This also means that moderators should be more careful in what they say and how they use their privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention.

So far, we've been pretty good at closing crank questions.  I would strongly prefer questions be closed by the community, and I would try to cast close votes only as fifth votes.  However, if the site gets over-run by attention-seekers and it becomes evident that the community is ill-equipped to deal with them, then I (in consultation with the other mods) would become more active in closing and deleting content.  If certain people are persistently abusing the site, they can be suspended.

Searching for mathematical knowledge is quite difficult, especially when you are even a little bit away from your core field of expertise. The combined expertise of CSTheory participants is a really effective way for finding that elusive theorem, or reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is another role of CSTheory that I care very much about, but is harder to explain. What I have in mind is closely related to Thurston's &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On Proof and Progress in Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. As with other fields of math, we record progress in TCS in a formal style in technical papers. We also give technical talks, and seminars. However TCS is much more than a collection of proven theorems, and algorithms. A community of researchers shares intuitions, heuristics, mental models, and all of these are essential to making progress in TCS and keeping it alive. Mind you, often these insights are specific to subfields of TCS.  These aspects of our culture are hard to capture in technical articles and talks, and we need other means of communicating them. This can be through tutorials, workshops, expository writing, monographs. And also through CSTheory. Here a researcher unfamiliar with some subfield of TCS can tap the collective wisdom of experts, ask for the intuitions and motivations behind theorems, proofs, and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the flags are caused by the user's breaching community guidelines and by disrespectful behavior, I would warn them via comments. If this is not effective, and the disrespectful behavior continues, I would suspend them for a period of time. If the user's behavior makes CSTheory hostile and unwelcoming, this will likely put off many other users. The &quot;steady stream of valuable answers&quot; will not be worth losing many other valuable experts and making CSTheory unpopular. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would bring up the question in meta, so that we can both get feedback from the community. At the end of the day, community consensus should prevail, and I would of course accept the consensus decision, no matter whether I entirely agree with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To a large extent this is answered by what I wrote for the first question. In order for CSTheory to play the role I wrote about, we would need participation from experts in most of the active fields of TCS. I think there are fields where we would benefit from wider representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think basing decisions on the level of maturity of the user is the wrong way to go. Questions should stand on their own. It may be rare that an inexperienced user stumbles into a nice, specific enough question, but it has happened. At the end, the artefact that remains for the community is the question and the answers. And if a question is close enough, it can be edited to make it just right (but reworking questions entirely is not acceptable). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are questions that are so broad and vague that they do capture, almost by accident, some deep issue. It is better if such question is closed, but feedback is given to the users so that they can improve their question to focus on the interesting issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators resolve issues (by resolving flags and closing questions) that need immediate attention, and where the action to be taken is clear (in terms of broad consensus or accepted community rules). Moreover, by virtue of their role, they can and should start discussions on issues important to the community, and they should lead by example in setting standards in CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will be a reminder to act in balanced and responsible way. But it will not change the way I answer and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Binding close votes would enable me to take immediate action where such action is needed. The ability to suspend users would allow me to deal with particularly disruptive situations, in extreme cases. Moreover, the status as a moderator would allow me to lead by example in setting community standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that a low quality flag that does not point to a real issue does not require intervention. A chatty flag that does raise a legitimate concern (in a chatty way) may require attention, however. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&#xA;  If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes?

(Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a hard question. I think the community has been good at downvoting and closing low-quality questions, and questions that clearly have an agenda that is incompatible with the goals of the site. We have also been mostly good at downvoting low-quality answers. Unfortunately, over a long period of time a user can collect a substantial amount of points from a large number of mediocre answers (say no more helpful than a Google search). The best way I can see of addressing this situation within the system is prompt moderator action in closing questions that are posted simply to draw attention to a crank's attempts at solutions of open problems. The site's tools should work fine if the level of participation from the community is high, and in order to keep the community's interest in the site we need to keep the questions on topic (research level, in TCS). Besides using the moderation tools, leaving comments on inappropriate questions, moderators could also set an example by posting questions that are at the appropriate level for CSTheory, or by encouraging users to post good questions/answers initially left in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4896" LastEditorUserId="4896" LastEditDate="2014-01-22T04:27:30.660" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:27:30.660" CommentCount="0" />

I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037&quot;&gt;Original proofs generated on the parent site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037&quot;&gt;References to cstheory in the literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037&quot;&gt;policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics&lt;/a&gt;, I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can make sure of this by continuing to ask great research-level questions and providing amazing answers. However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation. These sort of users are unavoidable, and in most cases they don't cause much trouble. However, if a specific user continually upsets the community then I will proceed as in the &quot;large number of arguments/flags&quot; question: discuss with the user and community and suspend if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1037" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:10:11.417" CommentCount="1" />

At that point, the &quot;scratchpad&quot; comments are no longer needed, and may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn't always work that way in practice, but that's the way it's designed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do, to try and get a little closer to the ideal, is to occasionally go over your old answers and see if any of them have comments (written by you or someone else) that add value to the answer.

Also, if any questions you've asked have been effectively answered via comments, you can either summarize the conclusions into a self-answer (again, with appropriate credit, of course) or just ask the user who posted the most useful comment(s) to turn them into an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, once the comments have been turned or edited into answers, you may also want to delete them (if they're yours) or flag them as obsolete (if not) immediately.

I personally wouldn't mind that much if they were really good and interesting questions or if the user seemed to really care about them (questions that the authors are actively thinking about and working on and really wants answers for, not out of idle curiosity questions). &#xA;However, it seems to me that these recent pseudonym users are not posting because they really have questions but for some other reason.

In cases where there are no clear violation of rules but the behavior seem nonconstructive, disruptive, or annoying to other users (in a way that a user with real identity would not act) the moderators should still contact the user to seek explanation if that is possible (e.g. the user provides a email address that can be used to contact the user) and if not possible to contact the user or the user does not provide reasonable explanation for the behavior then the moderators simply merge, suspend, destroy the account, or take an appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2014-04-24T20:29:29.910" CommentCount="0" />

My anecdotal experience is that, on this site (CSTheory), flags to flag a comment as &quot;obsolete&quot; are almost always declined.  On some other SE sites that I frequent, my flags of this sort are often granted (if they meet the criteria).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, reviewing my flagging history on CSTheory.SE, I see that I've raised 23 flags to flag comments as obsolete; 21 were declined and 2 were marked helpful.

It's not unreasonable or unexpected.  Moderators are people, and different people will have a slightly different approach and different interpretations of what is desirable.  Also, different sites are different communities, and different communities will have different values.  So, I've learned not to bother flagging comments as &quot;obsolete&quot; on CSTheory, because I've learned that the moderation crew doesn't seem to find those flags helpful; whereas on other sites I do tend to try to clean up old obsolete comment threads if it seems like it will improve the quality of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastEditorUserId="5038" LastEditDate="2014-06-18T13:36:00.540" LastActivityDate="2014-06-18T13:36:00.540" CommentCount="2" />

And does each serve do the database query in parallel with handling the request, or sequentially?  Those will affect the answer.

I can see two plausible possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 1: Have a set of tags which are eligible for this, e.g., algorithms, complexity-theory, computability, undecidability, etc.  Any question with vote total of 10+ and with at least one tag in the whitelist would then be eligible to be shown on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might whittle down the list of questions to those that are related to theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it has the problem that many of the questions selected in this way will not be research-level.  There are a lot of questions on CS.SE with 10+ votes that are not research-level questions in theoretical computer science, and they might be unwelcome on CSTheory.  Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE&lt;/a&gt; sorted by vote total, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory?sort=votes&amp;amp;pageSize=50&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see what I mean.  Only a small fraction of the highest-voted questions there would be a good fit for CSTheory; the majority would not be useful to display on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the top 50 highest-voted questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag.  All of them have a vote total of 10 or higher.  By my own highly personal assessment, about 10 of them look like they would be good to display on the CSTheory.SE front page.  The others don't look like great candidates (they are elementary, of narrow interest, or were about proving NP-hardness of a specific problem and the question has already been solved).  A 20% hit rate isn't great.  But this is my own personal taste, and others may differ.  I encourage readers to do their own count, see what they get, and post their own evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 2: Allow moderators to select which questions are eligible for display in this way.  This could be indicated, for instance, via a moderator-only tag that's added to the question on CS.SE, which triggers it to be shown on CSTheory -- analogous to the &quot;featured&quot; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would require some manual effort from moderators, but allows more control over which questions are displayed, and enables selecting questions which are research-level and which relate to theoretical computer science.  (A minor difficulty with using a special tag is that, if the question already has 5 tags, it may not be possible to add a 6th tag.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:48:30.257" LastActivityDate="2014-09-12T00:50:54.580" CommentCount="3" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Natural is not a well-defined concept. It is sometimes useful to ask for natural objects but there should be a reason why you are looking for a natural object. Asking for natural object in every question is not a good thing. You should have a good reason why you want a natural object and not an artificial one. In other words, when you ask for a natural object it would help to explain why you are restricting the class of objects to natural ones. The clarification of the intention would also help people know what you are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that if you are revising your questions too often based on the comments it can be a sign that you are not spending enough time to think and formulate your questions before posting them. Maybe you should try to spend more time thinking about the kind of answer you are looking for and trivial answers that people might think are answering your question but are not really, and then write the question in a way that people are not likely to interpret it in a way that you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2015-01-08T09:33:22.493" CommentCount="0" />

I proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/1438&quot;&gt;some criteria&lt;/a&gt; last summer (which we've been using internally for a while). My evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats&quot;&gt;6 migrations to and from CS Theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cs.stackexchange.com          =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xA;datascience.stackexchange.com =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&amp;gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days&quot;&gt;close statistics&lt;/a&gt; it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16884" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2015-12-23T01:32:29.217" CommentCount="6" />

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle.

Thank you to Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen for having stood up as a candidate in this session. However, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/2017-moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates&quot;&gt;explained previously&lt;/a&gt;, in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical Computer Science is not a site that's particularly in danger of low moderation. There's a healthy number of regular users across most reputation brackets who remain active on the site, still handling general moderation tasks.  The flag load itself isn't particularly large, and the current moderation team has expressed that they aren't overwhelmed by it. However, only one of the current moderators is highly active - while this is sufficient for the current flag load, it is healthier for the site to have multiple active moderators, not only to split even the small loads but also to handle situations where one of the moderators may have more pressing matters to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be that now is just not a good time to have hosted an election for this site.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Also, if a comment no longer makes sense because related comments have already been deleted, it should make sense to delete. Moreover, if someone goes out of their way and flags a comment like &quot;Thanks!&quot; as no longer needed, I'd tend to go along with that. On the other hand, comments are often substantial and should be kept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;I have a bit the impression that part of the reason why the &quot;inactivity&quot; of the moderators came to the attention of SE was the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38803/is-norbert-blums-2017-proof-that-p-ne-np-correct&quot;&gt;Is Norbert Blum&amp;#39;s 2017 proof that $P \ne NP$ correct?&lt;/a&gt; which attracted some inappropriate content and corresponding flags.

So, keep in mind, there will be things that need fixing! We'll address those things as we can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to review it, here's how:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How do I enable it?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/preferences&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; and check the &quot;Beta test new themes&quot; option. This will turn on the new theme for all sites that have one in testing, including this one. &lt;em&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314542/opt-in-to-beta-testing-new-themes&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt; on how to opt in.&lt;/em&gt; You can uncheck the box to revert to the older theme until the site is live for everyone. &lt;strong&gt;Note, while turning it on is immediate, it will take a few minutes to revert to the old view - &lt;em&gt;but it will go through!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What type of feedback do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;On this post: Bugs related to this site's design elements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please help us look for issues/bugs related to the theme design and how we have mapped the old theme to the new. This needs to be done within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes&quot;&gt;limits of the new unified theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could include colors of sections of the design or text, problems with JavaScript add-ons (if applicable), the logo or top banner appearance or other artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also feel free to ask questions about the new layout if you're unsure how to navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;On Meta Stack Exchange: General concerns about left nav or theming&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some things that are definitely changing everywhere and can't really be adjusted on a per-site basis. A few of them include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336&quot;&gt;instructions here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the &quot;disable responsiveness&quot; link in the footer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness&quot;&gt;this Meta Stack Exchange post&lt;/a&gt; is the right place for feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;amp;A experience better. This is addressed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-meta&quot;&gt;Meta Stack Exchange post&lt;/a&gt; if you want more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What new themes?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're like, &quot;What the heck are you talking about?&quot;, then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes&quot;&gt;Rollout of new network site themes&lt;/a&gt; (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/3033&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32595" LastActivityDate="2019-01-26T16:27:32.713" Title="Community Promotion Ads — 2019" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />
